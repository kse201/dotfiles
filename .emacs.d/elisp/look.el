;;; Commentary:

;;;   I used `look.el' created by Mr. Namba, and I was very impressed with it.
;;; But I thought it was very regrettable that with his version of `look.el'
;;; candidates after coming first one are shown in other window and a user is
;;; compelled to repeatedly type C-u, C-L -- bound to a function called
;;; (look-here) -- until a user get what he/she wants.

;;;   So I've created new interface for `look' command in Emacs.  It provides
;;; a user with a interface like so called `Front End Processor' of Japanese.
;;; That is, a user can select a words in candidates shown in a minibuffer by
;;; typing `A', `S', `D' or `F' key -- keys near the home position --
;;; attributed to a word they want.  If there are more candidates, Type `SPC'
;;; key for more, `X' or `DEL' key for less.  `ESC' or `Q' key for quitting
;;; selecting candidates mode and restarting normal edit in Emacs.  You may
;;; use small letters for all such commands.  Note that first candidates are
;;; inserted automatically first of all.

;;;   Mr. Namba helped me a lot for creating my version of `look.el' and grant
;;; me to use the name for my version, too.  He said that it must be very
;;; useful for either people who speak English as their native language or
;;; not, so I should contribute it to the FSF.	And I will do it.  Thank you
;;; very much, Mr. Namba!

;;; for Install:

;;;   Suggested key bind to (look-here) command is;
;;;	  (global-set-key "\M-L" 'look-here)
;;;   You may put the following lisp expression in your ~/.emacs;
;;;	  (autoload 'look-here "look" nil t nil)
;;;   Set applicable variable for your look to the variable
;;; `look-command-spec'.  See below.
