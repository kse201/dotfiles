Still, there&#8217;s plenty of room for innovation in this space, and Justice Frangipane&#8217;s new design is a perfect example of how things can still get better in this market. Frangipane&#8217;s project is an iPhone case that while only 3mm thick, holds a Bluetooth 4.0 video game controller that recharges via solar power.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theflipside/the-iphone-game-controller-case-with-ble-and-solar?token=8917b17c\">Launching today on Kickstarter</a>, the project is a concept that creator Justice Frangipane has been working on for the last year, but now he&#8217;s working with iDevices, the creators of the Bluetooth i<a title=\"The iGrill Turns Your iPhone Into The World's Flashiest Meat Thermometer\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/13/the-igrill-turns-your-iphone-into-the-worlds-flashiest-meat-thermometer/\">Phone meat thermometer iGrill</a>, to help make it a reality. It features a controller that snaps into the back of a super thin iPhone case, providing physical controls compatible with specific games on iOS that support Bluetooth accessories. It not only charges via solar power, but can also use &#8220;trickle charging&#8221; to sip on low light and indoor light sources, too. The goal was to build a device you never had to build in, and Frangipane says in the project description that they&#8217;ve managed to achieve that.</p><p>The controller also doesn&#8217;t need that much energy to do its thing, thanks to the use of Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy tech,. That will help it connect to the iPhone without sucking down too much juice on either side of the equation, in order to get four hours of play time on a full charge without any light source. And Bluetooth 4.0 also means that response time for input is dramatically improved: BLE has a 6 second response time, Frangipane says, vs. a sluggish 100 milliseconds for older Bluetooth specifications.</p><p>Frangipane says that the project has Apple&#8217;s support, and that in fact, the iPhone maker has agreed to work with their team to help make sure the controller works with iOS devices, thanks to help from iDevices. At this stage, the prototype still looks like something created by a home hacker in a garage, but it clearly demonstrates that the concept works: by the time it ships, Frangipane says the control pods will snap into place on the front of the device in the case frame, and of course any wires or connectors will be less exposed.</p><p>Backers can get shipping devices for $60, with an estimated delivery date of June 2013. If you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, there are 125 prototype testing spots open at the $500 pledge level. Overall, the team hopes to raise $135,000 to bring the controller to market.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725564/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/5O4JIVEQJ2g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/now-on-kickstarter-a-thin-solar-powered-bluetooth-4-0-game-controller-built-directly-into-an-iphone-case/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Nothing in the description of either of these games would lead anyone to believe that these aren&#8217;t official ports (besides a few instances of dodgy sentence structure), and each in fact advertises iOS-specific features like Game Center integration.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/halo-4-ios.jpg\"></a>The illusion even permeates down to the developer and support links for each app, which takes you to a page for Halo 4 that event claims a 343 Industries copyright at the bottom. That&#8217;s not like the scams we&#8217;ve seen in the past where developers have provided so-called &#8220;guides&#8221; for Minecraft that lift assets and look like the game itself in screenshots and description, but have a small disclaimer noting they aren&#8217;t actually a game. This is a full-blown scam, without any possible defense, and it&#8217;s a shame to see it hit the App Store right when downloads usually pop over the holidays, and when Apple is in a position where it might not be able to do anything to reverse it until the freeze lifts December 28.</p><p>I&#8217;ve opted not to link them here because I&#8217;d rather not contribute to their heinous plot, but check out AppShopper if you&#8217;re curious and want to see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://appshopper.com/search/?search=halo+4\">elaborate ruse in full</a>. One thing&#8217;s for sure: whoever Dung Bui and Toan Tran (the developers listed for these apps) are, they won&#8217;t be getting back on the App Store anytime soon once Apple takes steps to resolve this mess. Speaking of resolutions, we&#8217;ve reached out to Apple to let them know about the offending apps and will update if we hear back. For now though, spread the word, since friends don&#8217;t let friends buy fake iOS Halo games.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/724942/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/l9iPaA90c_E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/halo-4-ios-scam-apps-look-to-lure-unsuspecting-iphone-and-ipad-owners-over-holiday-freeze/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Before it went public, one of its biggest backers was Softbank, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/28/zynga-confirms-softbank-investment-theyll-confirm-google-investment-later/\">pumped $150 million into the operation in 2010</a>.

Unlike other analytics companies, Kontagent is specifically focused on game developers and counts about 200 of the biggest freemium game developers like EA, Nexon and Kixeye among its clientele. They have a basic free version available to mobile developers through a partnership with Tapjoy. But for the premium version, they&#8217;ll do custom enterprise deals.

Collectively, the startup&#8217;s games include 50 different lessons that teach these grammar and contextual concepts along with over 1,000 essential vocab words, phrases and concepts. MindSnacks develops its games in-house, thanks to its growing teams of designers, engineers and educational content specialists. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-19-at-1-14-26-pm.png\"></a>Pickard says that the startup&#8217;s games aren&#8217;t meant to be a replacement for traditional learning tools, but are instead meant to act as a supplement to schoolwork and homework &#8212; or to provide extra tutelage for life-long learners. The key is to blend the addictiveness of the top mobile games with proven teaching methods so that language acquisition and test prep content becomes more digestible &#8212; and learning becomes something that&#8217;s actually enjoyable. </p><p>Next up, Pickard and MindSnacks will be looking to expand their portfolio to additional subject areas, like Math and Geography. Eventually, MindSnacks wants to be the go-to resource for those looking to learn about any subject in a gamified way on their mobile device. The CEO says the team isn&#8217;t looking to replace traditional educational tools but instead provide a complement to textbooks, video &#8212; and the other media that people are already using to learn new languages and study for those upcoming tests. </p><p>Find MindSnacks&#8217; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindsnacks-spanish-language/id385497068?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">new iPad app (for Spanish-language learning) here.</a> And find more on the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/mindsnacks-series-a/\">startup in our previous coverage here</a>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723538/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/qLp1PiL-IGw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/with-5m-downloads-to-date-mindsnacks-brings-its-addictive-educational-games-to-the-ipad/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The process, DeWolfe said, isn&#8217;t quite as simple as developing a Facebook game and then instantly converting it to mobile, but compared to the normal porting process, &#8220;it is like hitting a button.&#8221; (More concretely, SGN said that MasterKey can save up to 80 percent in conversion time.)</p><p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t force a developer to either build on Facebook or on iOS or on Android, and make them decide on one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That puts the small guy at a disadvantage.&#8221;</p><p>DeWolfe acknowledged that mobile and social game mechanics aren&#8217;t interchangeable, and that some Facebook games don&#8217;t really make sense on mobile. However, he pointed to casino games like Bingo Blingo as one category where the SGN strategy seems to be working. He argued that mobile and social gaming are ultimately &#8220;the same thing&#8221; — you just have to put some thought into each experience up front: &#8220;The mobile game as an afterthought won&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p><p>He added that SGN has significantly increased revenue quarter-over-quarter, is now profitable, and after a year and a half without acquisitions, may be ready to do some more buying. (Under its original name of MindJolt, SGN started out as a rollup of several gaming companies, and in fact acquired the company that gave it the SGN name.)</p><p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s a buyer&#8217;s market out there,&#8221; DeWolfe said.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/722071/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/rqj3XwnQcAE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/18/sgn-masterkey-launch/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The launch today follows <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120426005626/en/Zedge-Launches-Mobile-Games-Channel\">the company&#8217;s addition of a mobile games discovery channel in April</a>, which aimed to help Android users sift through the mountain of games available on Google Play to find relevant gaming experiences they&#8217;d actually enjoy.</p><p>The recommendation engine analyzed a wealth of anonymized behavior data gathered from its users&#8217; interaction with content across its channels (like wallpaper and ringtones, for example) in order to serve them with a list of game recommendations that match their preferences and interest. The apps&#8217; technology was developed to take advantage of machine learning and clustering theory to improve its recommendations over time &#8212; the more users interact with its system, the better the suggestions become.</p><p>Zedge CEO and co-founder Tom Arnoy tells us that he believes the company&#8217;s approach to content discovery and &#8220;the years of investment&#8221; it&#8217;s made on Android will immediately benefit iPhone users. Since implementing its game recommendation engine on Android, Arnoy says that Zedge has seen a &#8220;marked increase in user engagement&#8221; &#8212; to the point where the company now sees 1.5 million daily active users, which he believes is a testament to the improved relevancy and accuracy of its recommendations.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-8-27-00-am.png\"></a>Along with the launch of its iOS app, Zedge COO Jonathan Reich said that the company has also completed a significant upgrade to its infrastructure, providing what the COO hopes will be improved response times and download speeds by streamlining its architecture and by migrating to new hardware. This has all been a part of preparing for its iOS launch, and the company&#8217;s plot to make Zedge the &#8220;de facto standard for game discovery&#8221; on both iOS and Google Play.</p><p>While there&#8217;s a lot left to be said before it can claim that lofty title, Zedge has been able to gain market share by becoming the go-to place for Android users looking to personalize their devices &#8212; with 200 million downloads of its wallpaper, ringtones, and mobile content each month.</p><p>The New York City and Norway-based company spent nearly two years building its game recommendation engine and now allows users to receive customized recommendations of content they might like to download, which includes descriptions, screen shots, and ratings. The engine considers handset information, geographic data, clicks, installs and uninstalls, while combining those data points with its own information gained from reccurring usage.</p><p>This gives it access to a wide range of personal and demographic data, building a taste profile on individual users, allowing it to target its recommendations with more accuracy than the average mobile discovery engine. This more targeted experience has drawn advertisers like Pocketgems, Ngmoco and Gameloft, Reich says.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-8-26-50-am.png\"></a>For now, Zedge&#8217;s iOS experience is limited to wallpaper, as it plans to move vertical by vertical, adding ringtones and games (and in turn recommendations for each set of content) as it goes. Users can expect ringtones to be up and running in the first quarter of 2013 and games shortly thereafter.</p><p>While Apple purchased Chomp back in February to help improve its app search and discovery system, there&#8217;s still plenty of room left for improvement. The ecosystem itself still relies largely on Top Ten lists to offer recommendations and relevant discovery, which is limiting and leaves many hoping for a better solution &#8212; especially considering the top 25 developers currently constitute half of app revenue in both Google Play and the App Store. That has to change, and Zedge is hoping that it has the tools to help.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/719955/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/jYFfHBZYqU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/17/after-45m-installs-on-android-zedge-brings-its-content-personalization-experience-to-the-iphone/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The casual games leader sold to EA in July of last year in a deal that was worth up to $1.3 billion. Habermann&#8217;s departure follows a large-scale restructuring of PopCap operations this summer, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/24/3381822/plants-vs-zombies-creator-shuts-down-dublin-studio\">which led to the layoffs</a> of as many as 100 PopCap employees and saw the closure of the company&#8217;s offices in Dublin.</p><p>In a blog post at the time, PopCap co-founder John Vechey said that the restructuring had to do with the evolution of the gaming market, as gamers have increasingly shifted from paid to free-to-play games, along with a need to cut costs and increase efficiency. More in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.popcap.com/2012/08/21/popcap-update-from-john-vechey/\">Vechey&#8217;s post here</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Habermann has left all of that behind to join one of the first-movers in the online, video-based education space. The company was founded in the 1990&#8242;s and has slowly compiled a video library of 1,500+ how-to videos that are taught by industry experts, working professionals and teachers, served up in an online database for a monthly subscription fee of about $25.</p><p>In May, we wrote a lengthy piece on how the company had, over time, grown to a paying user base of over 1 million, and saw over <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/lynda-70m/\">$70 million in revenue in 2011 in spite of not having taken a dime of outside investment</a>. While the company may not feature the same sexy interface as some of the younger video learning platforms, it now has over 300 employees and a professional studio that focus on keeping the quality of its video tutorials high.</p><p>Since the beginning, long before the Codecademys of the world rose to popularity, the site has served those interested in a technical education, serving up how-to videos on popular apps and software from Adobe, Autodesk and Microsoft &#8212; on everything from web design to basic how-to-use-Excel content. This summer, lynda published its 500th course on Adobe apps, for example, and when Adobe released its Creative Suite this summer, lynda immediately had courses and how-to videos ready to go.</p><p>With growth headed north, the company has been looking to build out its educational content for developers and engineers and to take advantage of international interest, as lynda.com has long been English-only. On top of that, it&#8217;s been poised to take advantage of other platforms, specifically the penetration of mobile devices and social platforms.</p><p>That&#8217;s where Habermann comes in, as the new lynda.com CTO will help the company pursue growth strategies in cloud infrastructure and to scale on mobile and international platforms. The hire comes at a great time, especially as the CTO is fresh from helping PopCap scale its mobile efforts.</p><p>It&#8217;s also a great fit considering that lynda has a huge following of its Adobe-focused offerings, as it so happens that Habermann joined PopCap after 20 years at Adobe, where he was instrumental in the development of InDesign. Most recently, he was VP of core technologies at Adobe, where he helped lead the technical development of its flagship products like Photoshop, Acrobat, Illustrator and InDesign.</p><p>Habermann says that, along with the company&#8217;s founders, he shares a passion for education and is &#8220;looking forward to expanding lynda.com&#8217;s technology platform to take advantage of the opportunities in mobile, social and international markets.&#8221;</p><p>The company has seen an array of newcomers enter the space over the years, from Khan Academy to YouTube, and more recent additions like Udemy, CreativeLive and a host of course-creation platforms and MOOCs like Coursera and EdX, as well as technically-focused learn-to-code platforms like Codecademy and Treehouse. To continue to survive and grow in a crowding space, the company will have to continue to accommodate more functionality and content, co-founder Lynda Weinman says, and that expansion into mobile and international markets will be crucial.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-6-31-52-am.png\"></a></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/721337/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/FYQY3S42SUU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/17/popcap-cto-veteran-adobe-exec-frits-habermann-joins-learning-platform-lynda-com-to-help-it-go-mobile-global/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

I had been invited there by a game developer, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://erepublik.com\">eRepublik</a>, to attend an event celebrating the fifth anniversary of their game (also called eRepublik). eRepublik is one of my favourite consulting clients, so I was happy to be invited to participate in the festivities in downtown Bucharest and see what they had been up to.</p><p>But when I say &#8220;party&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean just visit with the team and go out for a few drinks while breathing in a whole lot of second-hand smoke (in Romania <em>everybody</em> chain smokes, restaurants still have smoking sections, and bars are free reign). Game conventions are not a new thing. Whether at a <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlizzCon\">Blizzcon</a> or a <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/expo/\">Eurogamer Expo</a>, gamers from across the world like to meet up and share their passions. The eRepublik event was not a convention, though. It was a summit.</p><h3>The Game</h3><p>First, some background. Though slightly older than the normal use of the term (especially with reference to Facebook games), eRepublik is essentially a social roleplaying game. It runs in a browser with static graphics, tables and retention-driven mechanics. Evolutionarily speaking, it sits somewhere between games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.planetarion.com/\">Planetarion</a> and <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.urbandead.com/\">Urban Dead</a>, and more modern Facebook roleplaying games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crimecity\">Crime City</a>.</p><p>It is also more focused on participatory play than, say, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/inthemafia/\">Mafia Wars</a>. Both developers and players readily admit that eRepublik can be pretty boring if played alone, and say that its real secret lies in <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>. There are dozens of public and private channels there where players gather to plot and discuss strategy, and this is where the value lies. If new players can find those channels, or if an existing player brings newbies into the fold, the game comes alive.</p><p>This tallies with the gameplay. Players are members of virtual countries engaging in industry, politics and war with one another across the world stage. The fantasy of the game is sometimes tied up in nationalistic passions (especially in Eastern Europe, where the game is most popular), and players from various countries have engaged in devious behaviour in the past in this vein. They can only do this by virtue of being socially connected and able to play together.</p><h3>A Gathering Of Whales</h3><p>The event was grandly called the &#8220;eRepublik International Summit 2012&#8243; because it was mainly about bringing that player community together, in meat space, to discuss the game and socialise. It also had a sense of theatre. The invitations were dressed up as a meeting of military and political leaders from all around the world. And the main session happened in a grand hotel ballroom replete with a UN Security Council style table (see photo), and name cards showing player usernames like Han Solo, Sunsetter and Peach. Many players and developers even arrived in suit-and-tie.</p><p>Some players had travelled a great distance on their own dime to be there. One example was a user named Oblige, who had travelled from upstate New York (with his girlfriend) on short notice to take part. Oblige is a very active player in the eRepublik universe, one of comparatively few from the United States. He&#8217;s been playing the game a long time, and considers it an essential part of his life. He is also what the social games industry would call a &#8220;whale.&#8221;</p><p>Social games operate on an economic model in which 95 percent of people who play will not pay, so all revenue comes from the remaining 5 percent. That 5 percent tends to follow a power-law curve. Most of them will spend maybe $10, some will spend $20, some $50 and so on. A whale is generally thought to be a player who spends more than $100, but $100 is actually on the low side. In eRepublik (and many other social games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=csr%20racing&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fen%2Fapp%2Fcsr-racing%2Fid469369175%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=Z13MUPzGDaKM0wW91oGQBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEetBMjY0iuURmmB1_HLnZ10YDASg&amp;sig2=IR39R0t1l2b5kRfXBu3cJg&amp;bvm=bv.1355325884,d.d2k\">CSR Racing</a>, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clash-of-clans/id529479190?mt=8\">Clash of Clans</a>, FarmVille etc.), some whales have spent over $10,000. They are the true fans, vital to the game&#8217;s success.</p><h3>Player Passions</h3><p>So the summit wasn&#8217;t the usual games convention because many of the players who had attended (350, I was later told) were whales. It was more like clan-gathering meets investor-conference. In eRepublik&#8217;s case this sense of a clan is compounded by the fact that around 40 percent of the game&#8217;s developers were once players of the game. Even the studio head, Mihai Adamut, started his involvement with the game as a player.</p><p>Past the introductions, socialising the night before and tours of the studio, the main focus of the summit was to talk about the game. eRepublik has gone through several major pivots over the course of its lifetime. It started as a political game, but has slowly become more about military combat. As often as not, the game&#8217;s whales have liked or disliked those changes, most notoriously when they rejected a whole new expansion of the game (called Rising) en masse. The studio has tried hard to listen to their concerns ever since.</p><p>At the summit, those concerns were many. Some wanted to know the exact details of how a new combat engine was going to work. Others wanted the economy fixed to balance production so that it might become useful. Some of the more political players wanted to see the game move away from war and back to diplomacy, and at least one (Sunsetter) called for the game to get back to its roots as a multiplayer experience. She felt that it had become too individualistic.</p><p>This was a theme that I picked up on when talking with George Lemnaru on the day after the summit. George is the creator of eRepublik (now departed to work <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://carscup.com/\">on a new project</a>), and a legend in the community as a result. He thinks that the game&#8217;s politics have gone by the wayside in favour of the military aspects and wishes he&#8217;d managed to solve that problem. However he is still very happy with what he managed to create overall. When I asked him what it felt like to be a hero to this community, he smiled and said it was a strange feeling.</p><h3>Conversation</h3><p>The word that is perhaps most important to conveying this experience is &#8220;conversation.&#8221; Although eRepublik is older than most social games, in some ways it&#8217;s a proto-example of what I describe as &#8220;<a title=\" \" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/zyngapocalypse-now-and-what-comes-next/\" target=\"_self\">generation-two social</a>.&#8221; The game doesn&#8217;t nag players to come back every day, isn&#8217;t preying on their social connections purely for user acquisition or lead them by the nose to click, play and spend. Instead it is focused on providing community value, and the studio largely trusts that the money will work itself out (with a few tweaks).</p><p>There are reasons for players to gather and help each other, to collaborate on common goals and breed social ties. This has led to a complex culture forming around the game, an emergent universe whose direction is rarely predictable. It has also led to a player community that is sensitive to change, but not reactionary: They want to see the game improve, get better, find ways to attract new users and expand just as much as the developers do.</p><p>That conversation is the value that whales seek. While some social studios have treated their whales much as Vegas-style high-rollers, whales are rarely spending just for their own personal aggrandisement. At the summit, Oblige expressed it best by saying that often they do so &#8220;to avoid letting their team down&#8221; in battles or activities against other nations. To be a whale is to be a leader, a participant and a clan member. It&#8217;s the social investment that matters, not the perks.</p><p>Players in any game often want to connect, to feel that social value and be able to self-express within a community of peers. In that conversation model the line often blurs between developer and player (as it has for eRepublik) and the resulting dynamic is hard to express. The game becomes something larger than any of its individual contributors, a synergistic experience which is not often apparent at face value. That conversation is the future of games.</p><h3>Lessons</h3><p>You can&#8217;t really afford to keep your whales at bay in a free-to-play world, to have an adversarial relationship with your players or act as though your mission in life is to squeeze them for money like a casino. That short-term attitude is what has gotten a whole lot of social game studios into trouble. Instead, think of your whales as supporters, like long-time sports fans who travel with you along this strange journey whose end neither of you fully understands. This has certainly been the experience for eRepublik&#8217;s makers and players.</p><p>Although some might argue that the game is doomed to a small niche, and will likely never scale, the loyalty of its active users cannot be ignored. When you have something as technologically basic as a browser game that manages to draw players from half way around the world to an event to talk about it, you are doing something very right. For half a decade, this apparently little game has managed to sustain two offices (the one in Bucharest and another in Madrid) and I see no reason why it couldn&#8217;t last another five years, or even beyond.</p><p>There are lessons there that all of us could learn.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/720715/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/KIHbMjxDLic\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/16/conversations-with-whales-the-erepublik-2012-summit/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Founded in September 2010, Toca Boca CEO Björn Jeffery describes the company&#8217;s structure as &#8220;a startup with a very friendly bank&#8221;: It&#8217;s independently run, but doesn&#8217;t have to worry about fundraising. That&#8217;s a different sort than many in the space.

This research, in fact, was performed before the iPad was even released.</p><p>After the iPad&#8217;s launch, Jeffery says they realized some of their earlier ideas were right, and others were a bit off. But what stuck out the most was the way the iPad was being brought into family homes and shared. &#8220;We thought it would be very interesting to see how we could make a shared experience on the touchscreen for children,&#8221; says Jeffery. &#8220;The touchscreen itself gives kids the possibility to have their first interactive media experience.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/kids-app-maker-toca-boca-passes-22-million-downloads-expands-to-android-with-kindle-fire-debut/toca-hair/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-720353\"></a>Toca Boca&#8217;s debut app, launched in March 2011, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-tea-party/\">Toca Tea Party</a>, which mixed digital and real-life play. (The iPad served as the host for a virtual tea party.) Subsequent releases have evolved that original concept of interactivity, but generally now have the child interacting with the characters in the app instead. The most popular series within Toca Boca&#8217;s portfolio, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-hair-salon/\">Toca Hair Salon</a>, allows kids to wash, cut, color and style various characters&#8217; hair, for example. So far, this series alone has produced over 10 million of the 22 million total Toca Boca app downloads. These are digital &#8220;toys,&#8221; says Jeffery, not digital games. The company had just 5 million downloads this time last year.</p><p>Today, the company is trying to spin off that success with the release of a sequel, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-hair-salon-2/\">Hair Salon 2</a>.  Although it&#8217;s early, the potential is there for another hit. The app is now No. 1 on iPad in 18 markets, and top 10 in 55 markets. That&#8217;s in paid apps <em>overall</em>, mind you, <em>not</em> kids apps. In the U.S., Toca Boca&#8217;s largest market, it&#8217;s currently sitting in the No. 3 spot. Toca Boca&#8217;s apps are available in 146 countries worldwide and range in price from 99 cents to $2.99. A few are free. The company previously announced it was profitable, but it doesn&#8217;t discuss revenues.</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MueqTkUfiJY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>As for what&#8217;s next, the plan is to continue careful expansion into the Android market in 2013. Jeffery says that they have to research what that market looks like for them. Because of the fragmentation, they want to make sure they&#8217;re supporting the majority of their target market, but need to make sure the experience is sufficiently good on all the hardware. That&#8217;s one reason Toca Boca started by launching on Hair Salon 2 on the Kindle Fire. The other is that the Fire tends to have a &#8220;family-friendly ecosystem.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Expansion Through Acquisition</strong></p><p>In addition, thanks to the success of Toca Boca, Bonnier itself is now looking to grow its own portfolio of kids app companies through acquisitions. To that end, Toca Boca this year established offices in San Francisco, putting it closer to the kids app startups that might see joining Bonnier as a better way to grow their own businesses.</p><p>&#8220;Sweden is a nice place,&#8221; laughs Jeffery. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not the sort of place that people happen to be in. San Fransisco is more of a hub for these sorts of things.&#8221; He thinks that next year, the kids app market will be undergoing changes that will greatly impact startups building in the kids app space, which will make joining Bonnier a better fit for some smaller startups &#8211; especially those who want to grow a long-term business, not build a company to sell it in two or three years&#8217; time.</p><p>&#8220;The amount of money going in [the kids app market] is going to create a different market dynamic, and that is going to require a lot of smaller developers to think twice,&#8221; says Jeffery. &#8220;You have to have a sufficient amount of budget to even compete. That could be a hard time for a lot of smaller developers. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting 2013.&#8221;</p><p>Acquisition and partnership talks are now under way with a handful of kids app companies, Jeffery says. He expects no more than three acquisitions to be completed in the year ahead.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/720253/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/ufAkNUQ8C6s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/kids-app-maker-toca-boca-passes-22-million-downloads-expands-to-android-with-kindle-fire-debut/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Because I do. Are they really random? Or do slight imperfections in their design favor one number over another? It&#8217;s impossible to know. Unless you have <em>precision</em> machined dice. And while you&#8217;re precision-machining some dice, why not make them in a variety of rare and exotic metals? Those are the questions Tuscon college student Amber Rix created her Kickstarter project to answer.</p><p>Launched December 6, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/124127689/precision-machined-dice\">Precision Machined Dice project </a>on Kickstarter currently sits at $32,701, over 10 times its initial funding goal of $3,000. It aims to deliver American-made, six-sided dice in a variety of metals, including aluminum, stainless steel, copper, brass, titanium and tungsten to backers, but not just any old dice. These are precision machined according to exact mathematical standards, to ensure that each die has a precisely (or as near as is feasible) equal chance to land on any one of its six sides. Rix has a very in-depth mathematical explanation of how she hopes to achieve that, but essentially it amounts to drilling different hole depths on each face depending on how many pips are present, in order to balance the cube&#8217;s overall mass.</p><p>I&#8217;m not going to pretend I understand the math at work here. Rix&#8217;s explanation on the Kickstarter page is likely a much better read than whatever insight I can provide if you&#8217;re after the nerdy nitty-gritty.</p><p>I asked Rix why she wanted to make these to begin with, and at its heart the project is about delivering perfection to everyday folks. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do something you might as well do it right, right?&#8221; she said.  &#8221;I could have very easily made cubed chunks of metal with drilled pips, but all of a sudden with a little more time and effort these chunks of metal become near perfect precision &#8216;cuts&#8217; of metal. Rare metals. They are novelty items that no one else in the world may have.&#8221;</p><p>Personally, Rix was moved by her love of computer-aided drafting and product design to come up with these dice. As a college student working on graphic design and CAD, she wanted to make something that would help her share that passion with the rest of the world.</p><p>&#8220;I get the biggest thrill from making something digitally and then eventually being able to hold what I made in my hand, that&#8217;s why I love CAD so much,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;And nothing is worth doing if you don&#8217;t give it your all, so I made them precision. Anyone can make a cube in CAD or Solidworks, but its harder to make it precision, and the extra work makes the reward of completion a hundred times better.&#8221;</p><p>The stretch goal for the project was to get enough funding to be able to make dice out of relatively expensive tungsten metal. Now, the project has reached that level, and Rix has bigger dreams, including creating dice out of Damascus steel, and possibly even silver. She also would now like to look into the possibility of making her precision dice a product that continues beyond the initial Kickstarter shipment, sold through Amazon or perhaps her own website. Other potential projects could involve D4 through D20 dice, likely an attractive prospect to the perfectionist DnD-er, and a full game board created from precision-crafted metal.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/720208/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/rCLXyNd17fo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/dice-better-than-any-dice-youve-ever-owned-pass-10x-their-kickstarter-funding-goal-in-one-week/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

With rising marketing costs, it&#8217;s becoming ever more important to be thoughtful about the types of audiences you attract and how you retain them. Ideally, a mobile app that monetizes well maximizes engagement (or the number of times a user interacts with a game on a weekly basis). The more they interact with an app, the more opportunities there are for in-app purchases or other transactions.</p><p>In the graph above, Flurry divides games into four types. Quadrant 1 is the &#8220;sweet spot,&#8221; where games not only retain users well, but keep them actively engaged on a weekly basis. Social turn-based games, slots and casual simulation titles (like the familiar farming or zoo games) do well in this category. Game mechanics that set &#8220;appointments&#8221; like the need to water plants every nine hours, get users back into games. That said, these are more casual titles that don&#8217;t necessarily attract higher-paying players. The quality bar has also become a lot higher for these types of games over the last 18 to 24 months, so barriers to entry are higher for new competitors.</p><p>The second quadrant just has room for strategy games, which have a shorter lifecycle because users churn through content very quickly. With these types of games, developers have to drive monetization through player vs. player mechanics. While the 90-day retention is not as strong as in Quadrant 1, these types of games are part of the trend toward midcore gaming, which happens to attract a more select, but more lucrative audience.</p><p>The third quadrant includes card-gaming titles, which started out being popular in Japanese markets but have since crossed over into the West with titles like Mobage&#8217;s Rage of Bahamut. Publishers behind these titles have to be strategic about how they acquire users, since many of them drop off. The mechanics in these games are sometimes too complicated for newer users to follow.</p><p>The fourth quadrant has older types of familiar games like casino titles, solitaire and poker. Aside from poker games, solitaire and casino games might not offer that many opportunities for in-app purchases, but they do have inventory for advertising impressions. Flurry says even though these games might be harder to monetize, they can be good for cross-promoting more lucrative titles.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/engagement-mobile-games/screen-shot-2012-12-13-at-4-14-12-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-719858\"></a></p><p>Flurry also took a look at gender balances in these titles. These stats aren&#8217;t really all that surprising. Casual sim games, social turn-based games, slots and solitaire tend to attract female players while strategy and card-battle games attract male players. </p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/719851/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/Shl9Xe0lROI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/engagement-mobile-games/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The Game Minion acquisition today brings some quality engineering talent to the fold, but also provides Corona Labs with a whole new product offering, to be rebranded as Corona Cloud.</p><p>Game Minion&#8217;s current service provides leaderboards, push notifications, app analytics, achievements, cloud storage and more to developers, via just a single SDK instead of requiring that multiple ones are used in combination. A big tentpole of Game Minion&#8217;s service is that it can provide support for cross-platform multiplayer play, which is a very attractive offering for Corona Labs&#8217; gaming clients, which now include EA thanks to the launch of that company&#8217;s Word Smack game.</p><p>Corona Cloud will be a boon not just to Corona Labs&#8217; big clients, but also to hobbyists and indie devs who want to be able to offer the same kinds of features mobile gamers expect to see from playing big name games, but without the added development costs of creating those solutions in-house. Corona has good traction so far, with a little over 200,000 developers working with its platform since its launch in 2010, producing titles that have a combined 1 billion use sessions in just the past 10 months.</p><p>&#8220;The Corona SDK today is mainly geared towards just developing apps that you put onto the phone and onto tablets, what these guys do is add an element that blows away what&#8217;s out there today in terms of what you can do on the backend,&#8221; Corona Labs CEO Walter Luh told me in an interview. &#8220;I think if you look at the kinds of things that people want to do in games or business apps or stuff like that, they really make it incredibly easy.&#8221;</p><p>Luh and Game Minion co-founder Mohamed Hamedi further explained that what the acquired company brings to Corona won&#8217;t just be applicable to gaming apps; the infrastructure and services it provides can help with gamification efforts for sales tools, for instance, and also have uses that are applicable across a broad range of different types of applications.</p><p>The deal will see Game Minion&#8217;s team folded into Corona Labs, though for now the offices in Dubai will remain active, with a move stateside likely to follow. Existing Game Minion customers shouldn&#8217;t see their service change, and the rebranded Corona Cloud, which is currently in closed beta, is expected to open to the public in early 2013.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/719305/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/P_TNyevBE4g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/cross-platform-mobile-dev-company-corona-labs-acquires-gaming-cloud-service-provider-game-minion/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Since then the company has changed shape &#8212; morphing from app maker to platform creator. It&#8217;s also been working with carriers to build out IP-based network interconnectedness (aka the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joynus.com/\">Joyn</a> initiative). Right now, Jibe describes itself as a cloud-based global communications provider. Or at least, that&#8217;s its ambition &#8212; and that grand plan is where the new funding comes in.</p><p>Today&#8217;s funding announcement is Jibe&#8217;s only external funding to-date (not counting an $800,000 angel investment in its earlier business). In recent years the company had been producing revenues so did not need to seek other funds, the CEO tells me. But its new business has an extremely ambitious scope &#8212; firm emphasis on the words &#8216;global&#8217; and &#8216;cloud&#8217; here &#8212; so the financial resources required to both get it up and running and ensure it can scale as demand grows are an order of magnitude greater than its earlier app effort.</p><h3>A Platform For Apps To Call Each Other</h3><p>In a nutshell Jibe is building a cloud platform for app developers to more easily (and cheaply) incorporate rich, real-time comms/connected features into their apps &#8212; such as VoIP calls, video chatting and over-the-top multiplayer social gaming features. Using its SDK and APIs, Jibe says developers can add a Skype-style video calling feature to their app in a matter of minutes, for instance, by dropping in a few lines of code. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m/jibe_reversi_both/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717661\"></a></p><p>&#8220;In the case of video for example, with four lines of Android code they can make video work inside their app,&#8221; says CEO Amir Sarhangi. &#8220;They don’t have to know anything about SIP, IMS, any of the technologies that’s used in doing for example video chat – codecs – they don’t need to know any of that.</p><p>&#8220;As far as the infrastructure’s concerned, they’re leveraging our infrastructure – we have datacenters in multiple locations in the world and then we have proxy servers stationed in many, many different parts to make the experience really good.&#8221;</p><p>As well as having lots of datacenters to shuttle all the bits and bytes around &#8212; Jibe has offices in Mountain View, London, Düsseldorf and Tokyo &#8212; it is working with carriers to optimise its platform for their individual networks. &#8220;Underneath it all, wherever we have relationships with mobile carriers we can deliver a better experience so as an example if you happen to be a Vodafone user you’re just going to get an even better experience because we are tied into their network.</p><p>&#8220;But nothing is dependent on carriers so from a developer and a consumer perspective it works everywhere,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;As we turn on additional carrier relationships, our network gets better and the quality we can deliver gets better.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What we see is a vision of the future where all applications are connected &#8212; and by that we mean applications that essentially have things like video chat inside of them, VoIP, the ability to do things like multiplayer gaming with each other – so you’ve got two apps where you can play a game over the mobile network. Something that traditionally has been very very difficult for app developers to do just because of the nature of mobile networks and the complication of being able to deliver on various mobile platforms.&#8221;</p><h3>From One App To Another</h3><p>If you&#8217;re still scratching your head at the &#8220;cloud-based global communications provider&#8221; moniker, here&#8217;s a video demonstrating one use-case of Jibe&#8217;s platform &#8212; showing how an Air Hockey game app is able to incorporate a social gaming multiplayer mode, that allows the user to identify which of their contacts has the app and also has connectivity to play at that particular moment and then send a &#8216;gaming challenge&#8217; to ask their buddy to play. (&#8220;It’s almost like two applications calling each other&#8221; is how Sarhangi describes it.)</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3mxV_3-2Vj8?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>Jibe&#8217;s cloud platform does the real-time data transfer that links the two apps so the two players can play against each other from their respective phones and locations &#8212; with low enough latency levels to ensure decent gameplay. The best performance is on 4G networks (40 to 60ms latency in that instance), but Sarhangi says Jibe&#8217;s platform also works on HSPA and 3G networks &#8212; although some types of very time-sensitive games may suffer a bit of a performance knock at those slower network speeds.</p><p>Another feature of the platform is the ability to support multitasking real-time applications &#8212; so a video call window can be popped out so that other phone features can be accessed by the user while they carry on chatting, for example. The platform isn&#8217;t just for game developers either &#8212; Sarhangi flags up an e-learning use-case where a developer incorporated a digital white board into the mix to share video from a mobile e-learning app to a classroom screen. Many types of app developers could benefit from catching a ride on Jibe&#8217;s cloud, he says.</p><h3>Jibe Before The Pivot: Joyn-ing Forces</h3><p>This latest Jibe pivot grew out of work it did for Vodafone to help build <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joynus.com/\">Joyn</a> &#8211; a carrier initiative aimed at ensuring interoperability of IP services (such as IM and picture messaging) across different networks and geographies. Joyn does this through the use of a new, single communications standard &#8212; but has yet to get more than a handful of carriers signed up so it remains a work in progress.</p><p>One part of Jibe&#8217;s business is to act as a stop-gap for Joyn &#8212; to make good on the technology&#8217;s interoperability promise before mass carrier adoption achieves the same end (this part of its business is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jibemobile.com/carrier/joynnet/\">JoynNet</a>). But while working on Joyn, Sarhangi says Jibe also realised there was space to build a new business that sits between developers and carriers &#8212; to help the two groups help each other.</p><p>&#8220;We had a lot to do with Joyn to begin with and one of the main passions we have as a company is the fact that in helping create Joyn we realised that it’s extremely difficult for developers to do this stuff,&#8221; says Sarhangi. &#8220;So how do we make it really simple and, on the other hand, having been with carriers and worked with carriers it is difficult to work with carriers as a small developer, because they’re such a big company, so how do you make that also simple so that you bring the two sides together and break the barriers down.&#8221;</p><h3><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m-to-grow-its-cloud-based-app-developer-platform-wants-to-teach-carriers-how-to-win-in-an-all-ip-world/screen-shot-2012-12-11-at-18-21-48/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717719\"></a>Future features and fees</h3><p>In future, as the Jibe cloud platform develops, Sarhangi envisages being able to support four-way video calls, or modify voice or video calls with an overlay. &#8220;What you see now is the base, the foundation,&#8221; he says, adding that the company intends to be led by its developer community to incorporate the features they request. &#8220;When the developers themselves are successful that makes us successful so, for us, it’s not a race for as many features in the world, it’s a race to make them successful.&#8221;</p><p>Jibe&#8217;s platform, which includes support for Joyn so it&#8217;s &#8216;futureproofed&#8217; for carrier network evolution, currently supports Android apps but the company is working on iOS support (Sarhangi says it will &#8220;probably&#8221; be making an announcement on iOS availability in early Q1). It is also planning a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a> version.</p><p>The platform recently came out of private beta &#8212; and has more than 500 developers signed up. While it&#8217;s currently free for developers to use, Jibe&#8217;s business model involves charging developers in future &#8212; although it says it will only charge &#8220;once they are successful&#8221; – i.e. once their app has exceeded a certain number of concurrent video calls or voice calls made through Jibe&#8217;s platform.<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m-to-grow-its-cloud-based-app-developer-platform-wants-to-teach-carriers-how-to-win-in-an-all-ip-world/jibe_on_videocall_u2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717718\"></a></p><p>The funding round announced today will be used for &#8220;product side&#8221; work &#8212; such as completing iOS support. It will also be used to scale the platform to cope with increased demand. &#8220;Clearly we’re running a global cloud so we need a team to make sure that we can support a truly [global] experience,&#8221; says Sarhangi. &#8220;We need to be able to deliver [low latency performance] everywhere. And, as we have more of the demand it is pretty resource intensive to work with developers and carriers – two groups that are somewhat fragmented and require a lot of attention.&#8221;</p><h3>The Carriers&#8217; Cut: A Gamer-Proof Tariff?</h3><p>So what&#8217;s in it for the carriers to work with Jibe? The chance to &#8220;re-innovate around their core services in an all-IP world&#8221; &#8212; and a world of flat/declining voice and text revenues, says Sarhangi. Jibe&#8217;s platform should end up driving data revenues for carriers but more importantly it&#8217;s offering them the chance to investigate new business models fit for an age of over-the-top, all-IP services.</p><p>&#8220;Traditionally carriers haven’t been very good at doing something for the sake of it, and getting everybody excited about it and then figuring out how to generate the revenues. They’ve always been very financially driven. I worked for Vodafone for almost seven years running products and  services for Vodafone Japan and we never did anything unless it was fully <em>fully</em> thought out and financially feasible,&#8221; says Sarhangi.</p><p>&#8220;I think now they’re taking a different approach a little bit – they&#8217;re trying to take a page out of the internet book of how you do services and this scenario is not just about driving data revenue, it’s about in the future can there be a day where we can sell a plan where game developers can have this ultra high speed experience guaranteed to them for a fee?</p><p>&#8220;So it’s about segmenting their packaging and making their networks a lot more smart about how it’s packaged for both developers but also at the end consumers. I’ll pay the extra $5 if you can guarantee me that I’m always going to have a really awesome experience with my friends, playing these multiplayer games.&#8221;</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/717586/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/9Hdlty10vKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Before it went public, one of its biggest backers was Softbank, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/28/zynga-confirms-softbank-investment-theyll-confirm-google-investment-later/\">pumped $150 million into the operation in 2010</a>.

Collectively, the startup’s games include 50 different lessons that teach these grammar and contextual concepts along with over 1,000 essential vocab words, phrases and concepts. MindSnacks develops its games in-house, thanks to its growing teams of designers, engineers and educational content specialists. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-19-at-1-14-26-pm.png\"></a>Pickard says that the startup’s games aren’t meant to be a replacement for traditional learning tools, but are instead meant to act as a supplement to schoolwork and homework — or to provide extra tutelage for life-long learners. The key is to blend the addictiveness of the top mobile games with proven teaching methods so that language acquisition and test prep content becomes more digestible — and learning becomes something that’s actually enjoyable. </p><p>Next up, Pickard and MindSnacks will be looking to expand their portfolio to additional subject areas, like Math and Geography. Eventually, MindSnacks wants to be the go-to resource for those looking to learn about any subject in a gamified way on their mobile device. The CEO says the team isn’t looking to replace traditional educational tools but instead provide a complement to textbooks, video — and the other media that people are already using to learn new languages and study for those upcoming tests. </p><p>Find MindSnacks’ <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindsnacks-spanish-language/id385497068?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">new iPad app (for Spanish-language learning) here.</a> And find more on the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/mindsnacks-series-a/\">startup in our previous coverage here</a>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723538/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/qLp1PiL-IGw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/qLp1PiL-IGw/" (20690 11875) new 5 nil nil ((title nil "With 5M Downloads To Date, MindSnacks Brings Its Addictive Educational Games To The iPad") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/qLp1PiL-IGw/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/with-5m-downloads-to-date-mindsnacks-brings-its-addictive-educational-games-to-the-ipad/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 21:15:15 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Rip Empson") (category nil "Education") (category nil "Gaming") (category nil "Startups") (category nil "TC") (category nil "MindSnacks") (category nil "edtech") (category nil "Mobile") (category nil "language learning") (guid ((isPermaLink .

The funding was validation of the 2.5-year-old startup&#8217;s core mission: To help gamers turn those nagging Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja addictions into opportunities for learning. </p><p>In the same way those of my generation were spurred to learn basic math concepts from desktop &#8220;edu-tainment&#8221; classics like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Munchers\">Number Munchers</a>, MindSnacks set out to leverage the mechanics (and popularity) of mobile gaming to teach anyone and everyone the fundamental building blocks of the language of their choice. </p><p>The startup&#8217;s portfolio of games now consists of 14 language acquisition and test preparation apps &#8212; that range from SAT help to French and Mandarin &#8212; all of which have collectively attracted over five million downloads.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-19-at-12-27-19-pm.png\"></a>What&#8217;s more, according to CEO and founder Jesse Pickard, MindSnacks users have learned over 100 million words and phrases to date, 50 percent of users actively recommend the apps to their friends and over one-third of users have downloaded more than one app. This traction and engagement is impressive for a mobile-focused edtech startup and was part of what led to Sequoia&#8217;s recent investment. </p><p>Building on what is impressive traction and engagement for a mobile-focused edtech startup, MindSnacks is today announcing its most significant upgrade thus far, including the arrival of its bite-sized educational games on the iPad, six new mini-games and three redesigned classics and a new user interface.</p><p>The new version adds to the MindSnacks education experience, Pickard says, by covering additional areas of learning that are specific to each subject, which intend to impart a deeper understanding of the subject material by allowing users to practice sentence composition, conversation skills, and so on.</p><p>Each game is designed with a personalized learning algorithm that helps users maximize memorization, retention and contextual usage at their own individualized pace. Collectively, the startup&#8217;s games include 50 different lessons that teach these grammar and contextual concepts along with over 1,000 essential vocab words, phrases and concepts. MindSnacks develops its games in-house, thanks to its growing teams of designers, engineers and educational content specialists. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-19-at-1-14-26-pm.png\"></a>Pickard says that the startup&#8217;s games aren&#8217;t meant to be a replacement for traditional learning tools, but are instead meant to act as a supplement to schoolwork and homework &#8212; or to provide extra tutelage for life-long learners. The key is to blend the addictiveness of the top mobile games with proven teaching methods so that language acquisition and test prep content becomes more digestible &#8212; and learning becomes something that&#8217;s actually enjoyable. </p><p>Next up, Pickard and MindSnacks will be looking to expand their portfolio to additional subject areas, like Math and Geography. Eventually, MindSnacks wants to be the go-to resource for those looking to learn about any subject in a gamified way on their mobile device. The CEO says the team isn&#8217;t looking to replace traditional educational tools but instead provide a complement to textbooks, video &#8212; and the other media that people are already using to learn new languages and study for those upcoming tests. </p><p>Find MindSnacks&#8217; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindsnacks-spanish-language/id385497068?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">new iPad app (for Spanish-language learning) here.</a> And find more on the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/mindsnacks-series-a/\">startup in our previous coverage here</a>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723538/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/qLp1PiL-IGw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/with-5m-downloads-to-date-mindsnacks-brings-its-addictive-educational-games-to-the-ipad/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

I had been invited there by a game developer, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://erepublik.com\">eRepublik</a>, to attend an event celebrating the fifth anniversary of their game (also called eRepublik). eRepublik is one of my favourite consulting clients, so I was happy to be invited to participate in the festivities in downtown Bucharest and see what they had been up to.</p><p>But when I say “party” I don’t mean just visit with the team and go out for a few drinks while breathing in a whole lot of second-hand smoke (in Romania <em>everybody</em> chain smokes, restaurants still have smoking sections, and bars are free reign). Game conventions are not a new thing. Whether at a <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlizzCon\">Blizzcon</a> or a <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/expo/\">Eurogamer Expo</a>, gamers from across the world like to meet up and share their passions. The eRepublik event was not a convention, though. It was a summit.</p><h3>The Game</h3><p>First, some background. Though slightly older than the normal use of the term (especially with reference to Facebook games), eRepublik is essentially a social roleplaying game. It runs in a browser with static graphics, tables and retention-driven mechanics. Evolutionarily speaking, it sits somewhere between games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.planetarion.com/\">Planetarion</a> and <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.urbandead.com/\">Urban Dead</a>, and more modern Facebook roleplaying games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crimecity\">Crime City</a>.</p><p>It is also more focused on participatory play than, say, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/inthemafia/\">Mafia Wars</a>. Both developers and players readily admit that eRepublik can be pretty boring if played alone, and say that its real secret lies in <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>. There are dozens of public and private channels there where players gather to plot and discuss strategy, and this is where the value lies. If new players can find those channels, or if an existing player brings newbies into the fold, the game comes alive.</p><p>This tallies with the gameplay. Players are members of virtual countries engaging in industry, politics and war with one another across the world stage. The fantasy of the game is sometimes tied up in nationalistic passions (especially in Eastern Europe, where the game is most popular), and players from various countries have engaged in devious behaviour in the past in this vein. They can only do this by virtue of being socially connected and able to play together.</p><h3>A Gathering Of Whales</h3><p>The event was grandly called the “eRepublik International Summit 2012″ because it was mainly about bringing that player community together, in meat space, to discuss the game and socialise. It also had a sense of theatre. The invitations were dressed up as a meeting of military and political leaders from all around the world. And the main session happened in a grand hotel ballroom replete with a UN Security Council style table (see photo), and name cards showing player usernames like Han Solo, Sunsetter and Peach. Many players and developers even arrived in suit-and-tie.</p><p>Some players had travelled a great distance on their own dime to be there. One example was a user named Oblige, who had travelled from upstate New York (with his girlfriend) on short notice to take part. Oblige is a very active player in the eRepublik universe, one of comparatively few from the United States. He’s been playing the game a long time, and considers it an essential part of his life. He is also what the social games industry would call a “whale.”</p><p>Social games operate on an economic model in which 95 percent of people who play will not pay, so all revenue comes from the remaining 5 percent. That 5 percent tends to follow a power-law curve. Most of them will spend maybe $10, some will spend $20, some $50 and so on. A whale is generally thought to be a player who spends more than $100, but $100 is actually on the low side. In eRepublik (and many other social games like <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=csr%20racing&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fen%2Fapp%2Fcsr-racing%2Fid469369175%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=Z13MUPzGDaKM0wW91oGQBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEetBMjY0iuURmmB1_HLnZ10YDASg&amp;sig2=IR39R0t1l2b5kRfXBu3cJg&amp;bvm=bv.1355325884,d.d2k\">CSR Racing</a>, <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clash-of-clans/id529479190?mt=8\">Clash of Clans</a>, FarmVille etc.), some whales have spent over $10,000. They are the true fans, vital to the game’s success.</p><h3>Player Passions</h3><p>So the summit wasn’t the usual games convention because many of the players who had attended (350, I was later told) were whales. It was more like clan-gathering meets investor-conference. In eRepublik’s case this sense of a clan is compounded by the fact that around 40 percent of the game’s developers were once players of the game. Even the studio head, Mihai Adamut, started his involvement with the game as a player.</p><p>Past the introductions, socialising the night before and tours of the studio, the main focus of the summit was to talk about the game. eRepublik has gone through several major pivots over the course of its lifetime. It started as a political game, but has slowly become more about military combat. As often as not, the game’s whales have liked or disliked those changes, most notoriously when they rejected a whole new expansion of the game (called Rising) en masse. The studio has tried hard to listen to their concerns ever since.</p><p>At the summit, those concerns were many. Some wanted to know the exact details of how a new combat engine was going to work. Others wanted the economy fixed to balance production so that it might become useful. Some of the more political players wanted to see the game move away from war and back to diplomacy, and at least one (Sunsetter) called for the game to get back to its roots as a multiplayer experience. She felt that it had become too individualistic.</p><p>This was a theme that I picked up on when talking with George Lemnaru on the day after the summit. George is the creator of eRepublik (now departed to work <a title=\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://carscup.com/\">on a new project</a>), and a legend in the community as a result. He thinks that the game’s politics have gone by the wayside in favour of the military aspects and wishes he’d managed to solve that problem. However he is still very happy with what he managed to create overall. When I asked him what it felt like to be a hero to this community, he smiled and said it was a strange feeling.</p><h3>Conversation</h3><p>The word that is perhaps most important to conveying this experience is “conversation.” Although eRepublik is older than most social games, in some ways it’s a proto-example of what I describe as “<a title=\" \" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/zyngapocalypse-now-and-what-comes-next/\" target=\"_self\">generation-two social</a>.” The game doesn’t nag players to come back every day, isn’t preying on their social connections purely for user acquisition or lead them by the nose to click, play and spend. Instead it is focused on providing community value, and the studio largely trusts that the money will work itself out (with a few tweaks).</p><p>There are reasons for players to gather and help each other, to collaborate on common goals and breed social ties. This has led to a complex culture forming around the game, an emergent universe whose direction is rarely predictable. It has also led to a player community that is sensitive to change, but not reactionary: They want to see the game improve, get better, find ways to attract new users and expand just as much as the developers do.</p><p>That conversation is the value that whales seek. While some social studios have treated their whales much as Vegas-style high-rollers, whales are rarely spending just for their own personal aggrandisement. At the summit, Oblige expressed it best by saying that often they do so “to avoid letting their team down” in battles or activities against other nations. To be a whale is to be a leader, a participant and a clan member. It’s the social investment that matters, not the perks.</p><p>Players in any game often want to connect, to feel that social value and be able to self-express within a community of peers. In that conversation model the line often blurs between developer and player (as it has for eRepublik) and the resulting dynamic is hard to express. The game becomes something larger than any of its individual contributors, a synergistic experience which is not often apparent at face value. That conversation is the future of games.</p><h3>Lessons</h3><p>You can’t really afford to keep your whales at bay in a free-to-play world, to have an adversarial relationship with your players or act as though your mission in life is to squeeze them for money like a casino. That short-term attitude is what has gotten a whole lot of social game studios into trouble. Instead, think of your whales as supporters, like long-time sports fans who travel with you along this strange journey whose end neither of you fully understands. This has certainly been the experience for eRepublik’s makers and players.</p><p>Although some might argue that the game is doomed to a small niche, and will likely never scale, the loyalty of its active users cannot be ignored. When you have something as technologically basic as a browser game that manages to draw players from half way around the world to an event to talk about it, you are doing something very right. For half a decade, this apparently little game has managed to sustain two offices (the one in Bucharest and another in Madrid) and I see no reason why it couldn’t last another five years, or even beyond.</p><p>There are lessons there that all of us could learn.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/720715/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/KIHbMjxDLic\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/KIHbMjxDLic/" (20685 57883) new 13 nil nil ((title nil "Conversations With Whales: The eRepublik 2012 Summit") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/KIHbMjxDLic/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/16/conversations-with-whales-the-erepublik-2012-summit/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 16 Dec 2012 15:00:43 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Tadhg Kelly") (category nil "Gaming") (category nil "TC") (category nil "social gaming") (category nil "erepublik") (category nil "free to play") (guid ((isPermaLink .

The studio behind a series of popular children’s applications for iOS (iPhone and iPad) has just passed 22 million downloads across its portfolio of now 16 applications, and is today expanding to Android, starting with support for the Kindle Fire. More Android releases are planned for early next year, the company says.</p><p>Toca Boca, for those unfamiliar, operates like a startup within the family-owned, 200-year-old Swedish publishing company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bonniercorp.com/\">Bonnier</a>. Founded in September 2010, Toca Boca CEO Björn Jeffery describes the company’s structure as “a startup with a very friendly bank”: It’s independently run, but doesn’t have to worry about fundraising. That’s a different sort than many in the space. Often, kids app makers are either <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/night-day-studios-forgoes-funding-partners-with-scrollmotion-to-become-one-of-the-largest-independent-kids-app-makers-on-the-market/\">independent studios</a> or <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/kids-app-maker-duck-duck-moose-raises-7-million-series-a-from-sequoia-lightspeed-others/\">are backed by VC funding</a>.</p><p>Bonnier, says Jeffery, saw the potential for the iPad early on. “It was another take on media, instead of repurposing old IP and old materials,” he explains. “A lot of media companies just take what they have and put them on a new screen, and say ‘right, we’re finished.’” Toca Boca, however, grew out of earlier research in Bonnier’s R&amp;D division, where the company had developed concepts for how its media content could work on a digital, touchscreen computer. This research, in fact, was performed before the iPad was even released.</p><p>After the iPad’s launch, Jeffery says they realized some of their earlier ideas were right, and others were a bit off. But what stuck out the most was the way the iPad was being brought into family homes and shared. “We thought it would be very interesting to see how we could make a shared experience on the touchscreen for children,” says Jeffery. “The touchscreen itself gives kids the possibility to have their first interactive media experience.”</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/kids-app-maker-toca-boca-passes-22-million-downloads-expands-to-android-with-kindle-fire-debut/toca-hair/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-720353\"></a>Toca Boca’s debut app, launched in March 2011, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-tea-party/\">Toca Tea Party</a>, which mixed digital and real-life play. (The iPad served as the host for a virtual tea party.) Subsequent releases have evolved that original concept of interactivity, but generally now have the child interacting with the characters in the app instead. The most popular series within Toca Boca’s portfolio, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-hair-salon/\">Toca Hair Salon</a>, allows kids to wash, cut, color and style various characters’ hair, for example. So far, this series alone has produced over 10 million of the 22 million total Toca Boca app downloads. These are digital “toys,” says Jeffery, not digital games. The company had just 5 million downloads this time last year.</p><p>Today, the company is trying to spin off that success with the release of a sequel, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tocaboca.com/game/toca-hair-salon-2/\">Hair Salon 2</a>.  Although it’s early, the potential is there for another hit. The app is now No. 1 on iPad in 18 markets, and top 10 in 55 markets. That’s in paid apps <em>overall</em>, mind you, <em>not</em> kids apps. In the U.S., Toca Boca’s largest market, it’s currently sitting in the No. 3 spot. Toca Boca’s apps are available in 146 countries worldwide and range in price from 99 cents to $2.99. A few are free. The company previously announced it was profitable, but it doesn’t discuss revenues.</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MueqTkUfiJY?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>As for what’s next, the plan is to continue careful expansion into the Android market in 2013. Jeffery says that they have to research what that market looks like for them. Because of the fragmentation, they want to make sure they’re supporting the majority of their target market, but need to make sure the experience is sufficiently good on all the hardware. That’s one reason Toca Boca started by launching on Hair Salon 2 on the Kindle Fire. The other is that the Fire tends to have a “family-friendly ecosystem.”</p><p><strong>Expansion Through Acquisition</strong></p><p>In addition, thanks to the success of Toca Boca, Bonnier itself is now looking to grow its own portfolio of kids app companies through acquisitions. To that end, Toca Boca this year established offices in San Francisco, putting it closer to the kids app startups that might see joining Bonnier as a better way to grow their own businesses.</p><p>“Sweden is a nice place,” laughs Jeffery. “But it’s not the sort of place that people happen to be in. San Fransisco is more of a hub for these sorts of things.” He thinks that next year, the kids app market will be undergoing changes that will greatly impact startups building in the kids app space, which will make joining Bonnier a better fit for some smaller startups – especially those who want to grow a long-term business, not build a company to sell it in two or three years’ time.</p><p>“The amount of money going in [the kids app market] is going to create a different market dynamic, and that is going to require a lot of smaller developers to think twice,” says Jeffery. “You have to have a sufficient amount of budget to even compete. That could be a hard time for a lot of smaller developers. It’s going to be an interesting 2013.”</p><p>Acquisition and partnership talks are now under way with a handful of kids app companies, Jeffery says. He expects no more than three acquisitions to be completed in the year ahead.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/720253/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/ufAkNUQ8C6s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/ufAkNUQ8C6s/" (20683 30528) new 14 nil nil ((title nil "Kids App Maker Toca Boca Passes 22 Million Downloads, Expands To Android With Kindle Fire Debut") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/ufAkNUQ8C6s/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/kids-app-maker-toca-boca-passes-22-million-downloads-expands-to-android-with-kindle-fire-debut/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 19:00:16 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Sarah Perez") (category nil "Apps") (category nil "Gaming") (category nil "Mobile") (category nil "TC") (guid ((isPermaLink .

These are precision machined according to exact mathematical standards, to ensure that each die has a precisely (or as near as is feasible) equal chance to land on any one of its six sides.

With rising marketing costs, it’s becoming ever more important to be thoughtful about the types of audiences you attract and how you retain them.

Quadrant 1 is the “sweet spot,” where games not only retain users well, but keep them actively engaged on a weekly basis. Social turn-based games, slots and casual simulation titles (like the familiar farming or zoo games) do well in this category. Game mechanics that set “appointments” like the need to water plants every nine hours, get users back into games. That said, these are more casual titles that don’t necessarily attract higher-paying players. The quality bar has also become a lot higher for these types of games over the last 18 to 24 months, so barriers to entry are higher for new competitors.</p><p>The second quadrant just has room for strategy games, which have a shorter lifecycle because users churn through content very quickly. With these types of games, developers have to drive monetization through player vs. player mechanics. While the 90-day retention is not as strong as in Quadrant 1, these types of games are part of the trend toward midcore gaming, which happens to attract a more select, but more lucrative audience.</p><p>The third quadrant includes card-gaming titles, which started out being popular in Japanese markets but have since crossed over into the West with titles like Mobage’s Rage of Bahamut. Publishers behind these titles have to be strategic about how they acquire users, since many of them drop off. The mechanics in these games are sometimes too complicated for newer users to follow.</p><p>The fourth quadrant has older types of familiar games like casino titles, solitaire and poker. Aside from poker games, solitaire and casino games might not offer that many opportunities for in-app purchases, but they do have inventory for advertising impressions.

But Decrem said this is the first time his team has coordinated such a big holiday push between all of its titles — in previous years, he said, &#8220;We just didn&#8217;t have the network.&#8221;</p><p>Here&#8217;s what Disney is planning for tomorrow:</p><ul><li>The launch of 40 new levels featuring the character Dr. Doofenschmirtz in Where&#8217;s My Perry?, which will cost 99 cents, plus 20 new free levels</li><li>The addition of a new character, King Fergus, to Temple Run Brave, which will cost 500,000 coins</li><li>The addition of a new mini-game, Turbo Time, to Wreck-It-Ralph</li><li>The launch of the second episode of Avengers Initiative, featuring Captain America (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/avengers-initiative-hulk/\">the first episode focused on the Hulk</a>)</li><li>The launch of a new game called Monster&#8217;s Inc. Run, a side-scrolling game made in partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getsetgames.com\">Get Set</a>, the developers of Mega Run (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/04/temple-run-brave/\">Disney used a similar partnership to create Temple Run Brave</a>)</li></ul><p>And here&#8217;s what Disney is planning for December 20:</p><ul><li>The launch of a reef-building game called Nemo&#8217;s Reef, tying in to the 3D rerelease of Finding Nemo</li><li>The launch of Where&#8217;s My Holiday?, a holiday-themed variant on Where&#8217;s My Water? and Where&#8217;s My Perry?</li></ul><p>Decrem also talked shared some stats about the success that Disney has already seen this year. It had five number one games in the App Store: Where’s My Water?, Where’s My Perry?, Temple Run Brave, Tap Tap Revenge: Tour, and Wreck-It Ralph. Where&#8217;s My Water? alone has been downloaded 100 million times, and total daily active users across all the games peaked at 6.1 million in November (compared to 1 million in June 2011).</p><p>Since I was talking to Decrem, I couldn&#8217;t help asking about Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Lucasfilm. After all, Disney CEO <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/disney-star-wars-gaming/\">Bob Iger has said that the company will be focusing on building mobile and social Star Wars games</a>. However, Decrem said that the acquisition hasn&#8217;t closed yet, so there&#8217;s no news to discuss, except that he&#8217;s excited about working with the Lucasfilm/Lucasarts team.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/718735/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/LlYg2NSIciU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/disney-mobile-holiday-push/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Since then the company has changed shape — morphing from app maker to platform creator. It’s also been working with carriers to build out IP-based network interconnectedness (aka the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joynus.com/\">Joyn</a> initiative). Right now, Jibe describes itself as a cloud-based global communications provider. Or at least, that’s its ambition — and that grand plan is where the new funding comes in.</p><p>Today’s funding announcement is Jibe’s only external funding to-date (not counting an $800,000 angel investment in its earlier business). In recent years the company had been producing revenues so did not need to seek other funds, the CEO tells me. But its new business has an extremely ambitious scope — firm emphasis on the words ‘global’ and ‘cloud’ here — so the financial resources required to both get it up and running and ensure it can scale as demand grows are an order of magnitude greater than its earlier app effort.</p><h3>A Platform For Apps To Call Each Other</h3><p>In a nutshell Jibe is building a cloud platform for app developers to more easily (and cheaply) incorporate rich, real-time comms/connected features into their apps — such as VoIP calls, video chatting and over-the-top multiplayer social gaming features. Using its SDK and APIs, Jibe says developers can add a Skype-style video calling feature to their app in a matter of minutes, for instance, by dropping in a few lines of code. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m/jibe_reversi_both/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717661\"></a></p><p>“In the case of video for example, with four lines of Android code they can make video work inside their app,” says CEO Amir Sarhangi. “They don’t have to know anything about SIP, IMS, any of the technologies that’s used in doing for example video chat – codecs – they don’t need to know any of that.</p><p>“As far as the infrastructure’s concerned, they’re leveraging our infrastructure – we have datacenters in multiple locations in the world and then we have proxy servers stationed in many, many different parts to make the experience really good.”</p><p>As well as having lots of datacenters to shuttle all the bits and bytes around — Jibe has offices in Mountain View, London, Düsseldorf and Tokyo — it is working with carriers to optimise its platform for their individual networks. “Underneath it all, wherever we have relationships with mobile carriers we can deliver a better experience so as an example if you happen to be a Vodafone user you’re just going to get an even better experience because we are tied into their network.</p><p>“But nothing is dependent on carriers so from a developer and a consumer perspective it works everywhere,” he adds. “As we turn on additional carrier relationships, our network gets better and the quality we can deliver gets better.”</p><p>“What we see is a vision of the future where all applications are connected — and by that we mean applications that essentially have things like video chat inside of them, VoIP, the ability to do things like multiplayer gaming with each other – so you’ve got two apps where you can play a game over the mobile network. Something that traditionally has been very very difficult for app developers to do just because of the nature of mobile networks and the complication of being able to deliver on various mobile platforms.”</p><h3>From One App To Another</h3><p>If you’re still scratching your head at the “cloud-based global communications provider” moniker, here’s a video demonstrating one use-case of Jibe’s platform — showing how an Air Hockey game app is able to incorporate a social gaming multiplayer mode, that allows the user to identify which of their contacts has the app and also has connectivity to play at that particular moment and then send a ‘gaming challenge’ to ask their buddy to play. (“It’s almost like two applications calling each other” is how Sarhangi describes it.)</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3mxV_3-2Vj8?version=3&rel=0&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>Jibe’s cloud platform does the real-time data transfer that links the two apps so the two players can play against each other from their respective phones and locations — with low enough latency levels to ensure decent gameplay. The best performance is on 4G networks (40 to 60ms latency in that instance), but Sarhangi says Jibe’s platform also works on HSPA and 3G networks — although some types of very time-sensitive games may suffer a bit of a performance knock at those slower network speeds.</p><p>Another feature of the platform is the ability to support multitasking real-time applications — so a video call window can be popped out so that other phone features can be accessed by the user while they carry on chatting, for example. The platform isn’t just for game developers either — Sarhangi flags up an e-learning use-case where a developer incorporated a digital white board into the mix to share video from a mobile e-learning app to a classroom screen. Many types of app developers could benefit from catching a ride on Jibe’s cloud, he says.</p><h3>Jibe Before The Pivot: Joyn-ing Forces</h3><p>This latest Jibe pivot grew out of work it did for Vodafone to help build <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joynus.com/\">Joyn</a> – a carrier initiative aimed at ensuring interoperability of IP services (such as IM and picture messaging) across different networks and geographies. Joyn does this through the use of a new, single communications standard — but has yet to get more than a handful of carriers signed up so it remains a work in progress.</p><p>One part of Jibe’s business is to act as a stop-gap for Joyn — to make good on the technology’s interoperability promise before mass carrier adoption achieves the same end (this part of its business is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jibemobile.com/carrier/joynnet/\">JoynNet</a>). But while working on Joyn, Sarhangi says Jibe also realised there was space to build a new business that sits between developers and carriers — to help the two groups help each other.</p><p>“We had a lot to do with Joyn to begin with and one of the main passions we have as a company is the fact that in helping create Joyn we realised that it’s extremely difficult for developers to do this stuff,” says Sarhangi. “So how do we make it really simple and, on the other hand, having been with carriers and worked with carriers it is difficult to work with carriers as a small developer, because they’re such a big company, so how do you make that also simple so that you bring the two sides together and break the barriers down.”</p><h3><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m-to-grow-its-cloud-based-app-developer-platform-wants-to-teach-carriers-how-to-win-in-an-all-ip-world/screen-shot-2012-12-11-at-18-21-48/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717719\"></a>Future features and fees</h3><p>In future, as the Jibe cloud platform develops, Sarhangi envisages being able to support four-way video calls, or modify voice or video calls with an overlay. “What you see now is the base, the foundation,” he says, adding that the company intends to be led by its developer community to incorporate the features they request. “When the developers themselves are successful that makes us successful so, for us, it’s not a race for as many features in the world, it’s a race to make them successful.”</p><p>Jibe’s platform, which includes support for Joyn so it’s ‘futureproofed’ for carrier network evolution, currently supports Android apps but the company is working on iOS support (Sarhangi says it will “probably” be making an announcement on iOS availability in early Q1). It is also planning a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a> version.</p><p>The platform recently came out of private beta — and has more than 500 developers signed up. While it’s currently free for developers to use, Jibe’s business model involves charging developers in future — although it says it will only charge “once they are successful” – i.e. once their app has exceeded a certain number of concurrent video calls or voice calls made through Jibe’s platform.<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m-to-grow-its-cloud-based-app-developer-platform-wants-to-teach-carriers-how-to-win-in-an-all-ip-world/jibe_on_videocall_u2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-717718\"></a></p><p>The funding round announced today will be used for “product side” work — such as completing iOS support. It will also be used to scale the platform to cope with increased demand. “Clearly we’re running a global cloud so we need a team to make sure that we can support a truly [global] experience,” says Sarhangi. “We need to be able to deliver [low latency performance] everywhere. And, as we have more of the demand it is pretty resource intensive to work with developers and carriers – two groups that are somewhat fragmented and require a lot of attention.”</p><h3>The Carriers’ Cut: A Gamer-Proof Tariff?</h3><p>So what’s in it for the carriers to work with Jibe? The chance to “re-innovate around their core services in an all-IP world” — and a world of flat/declining voice and text revenues, says Sarhangi. Jibe’s platform should end up driving data revenues for carriers but more importantly it’s offering them the chance to investigate new business models fit for an age of over-the-top, all-IP services.</p><p>“Traditionally carriers haven’t been very good at doing something for the sake of it, and getting everybody excited about it and then figuring out how to generate the revenues. They’ve always been very financially driven. I worked for Vodafone for almost seven years running products and  services for Vodafone Japan and we never did anything unless it was fully <em>fully</em> thought out and financially feasible,” says Sarhangi.</p><p>“I think now they’re taking a different approach a little bit – they’re trying to take a page out of the internet book of how you do services and this scenario is not just about driving data revenue, it’s about in the future can there be a day where we can sell a plan where game developers can have this ultra high speed experience guaranteed to them for a fee?</p><p>“So it’s about segmenting their packaging and making their networks a lot more smart about how it’s packaged for both developers but also at the end consumers. I’ll pay the extra $5 if you can guarantee me that I’m always going to have a really awesome experience with my friends, playing these multiplayer games.”</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/717586/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/9Hdlty10vKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/9Hdlty10vKE/" (20680 4029) new 19 nil nil ((title nil "Jibe Mobile Raises $8.3M To Grow Its Cloud-Based App Developer Platform — Wants To Teach Carriers How To Win In An All-IP World") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~3/9Hdlty10vKE/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 05:01:49 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Natasha Lomas") (category nil "Apps") (category nil "Fundings & Exits") (category nil "Gaming") (category nil "Mobile") (category nil "TC") (category nil "jibe mobile") (category nil "voip") (category nil "video calling") (category nil "joyn") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I worked for Vodafone for almost seven years running products and  services for Vodafone Japan and we never did anything unless it was fully <em>fully</em> thought out and financially feasible,&#8221; says Sarhangi.</p><p>&#8220;I think now they’re taking a different approach a little bit – they&#8217;re trying to take a page out of the internet book of how you do services and this scenario is not just about driving data revenue, it’s about in the future can there be a day where we can sell a plan where game developers can have this ultra high speed experience guaranteed to them for a fee?</p><p>&#8220;So it’s about segmenting their packaging and making their networks a lot more smart about how it’s packaged for both developers but also at the end consumers. I’ll pay the extra $5 if you can guarantee me that I’m always going to have a really awesome experience with my friends, playing these multiplayer games.&#8221;</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/717586/\"></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Gaming/~4/9Hdlty10vKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/jibe-mobile-raises-8-3m/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .
