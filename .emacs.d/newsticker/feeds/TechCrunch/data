by the app up to 27. They are a sign of how the company continues to ramp up its international profile, not an insignificant effort because of the various clones &#8212; two European competitors for example are 9Flats and the Rocket Internet-backed Wimdu &#8212; that are emerging to meet demand. There is still some way to go in getting a fully-international operation up and running.

A: Yes and no. A lot has been written about the Series A crunch/palpable chill in Silicon Valley that&#8217;s making founders pull their cardigans a little closer. Most recently a report by a venture capital analysis firm CB Insights suggests there hasn&#8217;t actually been a reduction in the amount of money available, but rather too much seed funding causing too much demand for the same amount of cash at the Series A level. Whichever way you cut it, a lot of U.S. seed-funded startups looking to upgrade their backing to Series A level are going to be going away with an empty begging bowl in the future. But what about beyond the Valley? Does the funding situation in the U.S. have an impact on startup funding in Europe? As the old adage goes, if the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. So if Silicon Valley has a Series A chill, does that make the funding situation a little less forgiving for Europe&#8217;s seed-funded startups too? I asked several European VCs and investors for their views on whether the Series A situation in the U.S. is making life more difficult for startups in Europe. I&#8217;m not making any claims that this is a scientific poll &#8212; it&#8217;s a very small sample &#8212; but, nonetheless, it&#8217;s an interesting snapshot of opinion in the European investor community as 2012 draws to a close. My takeaway from the poll is that while this group of European investors hold slightly differing views on how much influence the Valley has on the funding situation in Europe, they tend to fall into two camps on the Series A crunch: those that say there&#8217;s no change in Europe because it&#8217;s always been tough raising a Series A round here; and those that say Europe is having its own mini seed-funding boom &#8212; which means that getting a Series A is probably going to be even tougher in the future thanks to increased competition. Sucks to be a European startup then &#8212; but if you do manage to get Series A, rest assured you worked your ass off to get it (and probably deserve it). Angel investor Jeremie Berrebi, who co-founded KimaVentures, says the U.S. Series A situation makes no difference to startup life in Europe. &#8220;The answer is simple: It was always difficult to raise Series A money in Europe&#8230;and it&#8217;s") (content:encoded nil "<img width=\"100\" height=\"70\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/5054527234_c07a2d1be74.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image\" alt=\"cc-image\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;\" /><p>Q: Is Silicon Valley&#8217;s Series A crunch causing a chill in Europe?

There’s more of a focus on a sustainable business model for startups in London.”</p><p>Angel investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julianranger.wordpress.com/\">Julian Ranger</a>&#8216;s take on Europe and the Series A situation is akin to Berrebi&#8217;s &#8212; he says: &#8220;Europe will remain as tough as ever as SV effects are limited on early funding here.&#8221; He also flagged up the importance of nailing down the business model &#8212; and points out that if a European startup is going to the U.S. for Series A then the key ingredients are a &#8220;good business model, a good team and reasonable valuation.&#8221; &#8220;If these hit the mark then you&#8217;ll have a good chance [of raising Series A in the U.S.]; if they don&#8217;t you won&#8217;t,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Same as anywhere really.&#8221;</p><p>Ranger also notes that since equivalent U.S. startups &#8212; at &#8220;same stage, same team capability, same prospects&#8221; &#8212; can be valued two to three times higher than European counterparts, this can lead European startups to assume they will get an &#8220;immediate uplift&#8221; in valuation if they take a trip over the pond. But that&#8217;s just &#8220;wrong thinking,&#8221; he argues. &#8221;Maybe the crunch (which is being over-hyped) will help startups realise that,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;You go the U.S. for funds because you want to access their market, their contacts and their scale &#8212; valuation will be a by-product and should not be the rationale.&#8221;</p><p>For <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/robin-klein\">Robin Klein</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/index-ventures\">Index Ventures</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://the-accelerator.blogspot.co.uk/\">The Accelerator Group</a>, Europe&#8217;s Series A situation looks like a microcosm of goings on in the U.S. &#8212; because he says the region has also had its own, albeit not quite so frothy, seed-stage investment boom, as governments have jumped on the startup bandwagon. &#8221;There has been a marked increase in seed-stage startup investing here, too. More angels, more mini funds, partly EIS  [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/eis/\">Enterprise Investment Scheme</a>] fuelled,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. He believes Europe is therefore set for its own version of the too-many-seed-funded-startups Series A crunch &#8212; with investor sentiment also being influenced by chillier climes over in the Valley. &#8221;The change in sentiment in the U.S. will affect sentiment here, too. It will become harder for companies to get Series A funding and smart seed investors should ensure that &#8216;runways&#8217; are long enough to achieve the milestones necessary. Boards of startup companies should try to focus very clearly on defining these milestones and ensure that they are achieved.&#8221;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/credo/our-team\">Ondřej Bartoš</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/\">Credo Ventures</a>, goes one further: there is already a Series A crunch in Europe that&#8217;s making it harder for seed-funded startups to get to the next funding level, he says: &#8220;Series A crunch is now a reality &#8212; and not just in the U.S., but we see clear signs (maybe not yet backed by statistics) of it in Europe as well. Today&#8217;s reality is that the chances of a startup with seed or angel funding to get venture financing are decreasing.&#8221; As to the cause, Bartoš also points to rapid growth in angel and seed deals &#8212; going so far as to describe it as &#8220;accelerator and angel investing hysteria.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;As far as I am looking at the market, I think the reason is not that the amount of available venture funds is decreasing (well in Europe it never was too high), but that the number of angel and seed deals is rapidly growing. With all the accelerator and angel investing hysteria which we&#8217;re seeing, it is not too surprising that often the quality of the startups with seed funding is low. If that&#8217;s really the case, we should be happy for the Series A crunch as it shows the VCs are keeping their quality standards high – and raising VC is staying as tough as ever which should be the case &#8212; only the best ones should succeed.&#8221;</p><p>So it&#8217;s not that Credo Ventures has reduced the amount of Series A funding it is offering &#8212; it &#8220;still has more than half of the fund available&#8221;, says Bartoš &#8212; but as with the CB Insights report, the problem here is too many seed-funded startups chasing the same pot of funding (and too many &#8220;low quality&#8221; ones at that). &#8220;We like investing into startups with previous seed or angel funding and/or accelerator experience. On the other hand, none of it is a guarantee to get funding, and yet we&#8217;re seeing lots of low-quality startups with previous seed funding,&#8221; he adds.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/runa-capital\">Runa Capital</a> partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andre-bliznyuk/1/26/a47\">Andre Bliznyuk</a> also believes the level of funding on offer at Series A won&#8217;t change. &#8220;We expect that Runa itself will continue to invest in Series A rounds at the same pace as before,&#8221; he says. So the key to unlocking that crucial Series A round is still both as simple and as hard as ever: basically, be an awesome startup. &#8220;We continue to believe that the strongest teams with the best products will continue to be able to raise financing, be it in Russia, Europe or the U.S.,&#8221; he adds. On a side note, Bliznyuk suggests that being an enterprise/B2B startup may increase the odds in your startup&#8217;s favour as that portion of the market has historically been less crowded than the consumer space. &#8220;We have also historically been more focused on enterprise/B2B software companies vs. consumer Internet startups, so our portfolio has largely been unaffected by the overall market exuberance,&#8221; he adds.</p><p>[Image by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/\">BlatantWorld.com</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/5054527234/sizes/m/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>]</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723945/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/g5km-aRS0h8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/from-silicon-valley-to-europe-is-the-u-s-series-a-crunch-affecting-european-startups/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

She is very passionate about all things technology, entrepreneurship and innovation. Follow her on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lachinous\">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p>The lack of women in technology in Latin America and the Caribbean is an issue whose cause has deep roots. Latin American women generally are not expected or encouraged to enter the hard sciences and engineering &#8212; medicine being one of the biggest exceptions. And unfortunately, private and public programs have yet to be developed or don&#8217;t provide the necessary resources to effect change. One exception is Chile, where public and private programs look to foster startups and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Contrast this with what’s been happening in the U.S. and Europe: The high positions that women hold, especially in the tech sector, as well as the entrepreneurial support they enjoy, has helped to create a trickle-down effect, resulting in more women in tech. In Latin America and the Caribbean, however, the numbers haven&#8217;t moved much. Women who have begun to appear in the startup scene tend to come from urban higher classes, and their numbers remain low. In addition, the number of women in technical positions (namely, CTOs) is also very low, even though entrepreneurship is currently dominated by educated individuals living in cities. Roughly one out of 15 women found in the startup scene is a coder. And, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startupchile.org/\">Startup Chile</a>, only 1 out of every 10 team members in a startup is a woman.</p><p>Still, despite the barriers, there are examples of women disrupting not only businesses, but entire societies all over the continent. They are working hard to solve complex problems in societies where they have a lot working against them. Entrepreneurship has proven to be an area where the few that excel really go the distance, particularly where technology is concerned.</p><h5>Assessing The Problem</h5><p>Last month, the UN organized a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unetelatinoamerica.org/2012/11/son-las-lideres-de-hoy-y-del-futuro_1888.html\">forum</a>, which was hosted by UN Women in the city of Panamá, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html\">United Nations Development Programme</a>, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/public/\">United Nations Population Fund</a>. The forum, entitled &#8220;Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Forum: Young Women Leadership and Governance, Sharing Experiences Worldwide,&#8221; attracted participants from civil and political organizations involved in the fight for equality and gender rights. And although entrepreneurship and technology were part of the agenda, only two participants and a couple of mentors came from the private industry, and just one represented the technology sector.</p><p>During the forum, the gaps between technology and social organizations became very clear. Most participants had very limited knowledge of the current technological resources available to them. Some representatives of indigenous groups were offline altogether. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.women2.com/\">Women 2.0</a> did not attend the event, and few representatives from countries where the organization had recently launched its Founder Friday events (Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile) had heard about them or what they do.</p><p>And some interesting parallels were drawn between female entrepreneurs and activists in Latin America and the Caribbean: both groups strive in the midst of numerous and difficult obstacles and are used to assuming great amounts of responsibility. However, activism is typically an area that many women pursue; entrepreneurship &#8212; particularly technological &#8212; is not.</p><h6>On A Mission To Slow The Spread Of AIDS</h6><p>Despite the obstacles, examples of women throughout Latin America leading startups and entrepreneurial projects continue to surface. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/maycupcake\">May Alba</a> is a co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rubberit.co/\">Rubberit</a>, a web platform that allows people to buy condoms online through monthly subscriptions. For every condom bought through Rubberit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dktinternational.org/country-programs/mexico/\">DKT International</a> donates another one to someone who can’t afford it. Rubberit just received its first shipment of DKT donations, which means they can return to their hometown of Guanajuato, Mexico, to distribute 5,000 condoms in one of the poorest communities in the area.</p><p>May says her original idea was not to start a web platform, but rather to develop an NGO to distribute condoms for free after seeing a good friend die from AIDS. Rubberit began with a social vision that matched entrepreneurship perfectly, particularly with the problem they’re facing: disrupting a mostly Catholic country where sex is taboo in many areas. May remained focused on solving her physical distribution problem but was running into all kinds of trouble.</p><p>She soon realized that helping people through a startup was easier and made more sense. It became more clear when someone directed her to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/\">Dollar Shave Club</a> where she got the idea to develop Rubberit as an online subscription service. She went in search of a technical co-founder and her brother, who had recently begun to code, offered to help. With some luck, they met their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mexican.vc/\">current investors</a> when a friend emailed them a link to the application page a couple of days before the closing date. They hustled to get a prototype together and went in for the interview. A few weeks later, they got some good news. “I didn’t over think it,” says May. “I just went with what felt right.”</p><p>Their biggest challenge has been distribution, since there is a widespread myth about the Mexican postal service not working. They have proved it does, since most of their distribution has been done through the regular national postal service. Getting the packaging right was no easy task, either. They make every package by hand, so it took seven prototypes to get to one that was sturdy enough, discrete, functional, and doable in under four minutes.</p><p>May says that their long-term goal for Rubberit is to become the main way condoms are bought (“the way you get water or gas &#8212; you get condoms and pay for them every month”). She says failure is an option only if they find another, more effective way to get condoms to everyone who needs them. Either way, they are keeping busy fighting big fights: namely teen pregnancy and AIDS.</p><h5>From Buenos Aires To Boston To Santiago</h5><p>Born near Buenos Aires, Argentina, and raised by a doctor and a schoolteacher, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Vanesak\">Vanesa Kolodziej</a> moved to Boston to work during the Argentine economic crisis. While in Boston, she worked briefly at Junior Achievement, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs develop and scale through best practices. Soon after, she started her MBA at Babson College, though never finished her degree. She also managed Fortune 500 accounts as the Hispanic Director at BzzAgent, a venture-backed ad agency. After , she launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bumeran.com.mx/\">Bumeran</a>. During the dot-com era, she led the creation of a crowd-buying company called Comunia. “It was a very intense period where I learned some of the harder lessons in my life as an entrepreneur,” she says.</p><p>Nowadays, after co-founding online tech community <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.palermovalley.com/\">Palermo Valley</a> for Argentina, she’s the managing partner and co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nazcaventures.com/\">Nazca Ventures</a>, an early-stage venture capital fund based in Santiago, Chile. It is the first Latin American &#8220;founders collective&#8221; fund where the five general and all limited partners are entrepreneurs. They started the firm when they identified a gap in the venture capital ecosystem in Latin America: there were hardly any early-stage investments. They are currently in their final stage of fundraising and will start investing in April 2013.</p><p>Vanesa considers being a woman in the tech industry in South America an advantage. &#8220;It helped me attract amazing talent, access key clients and vendors and develop long lasting partnerships.&#8221;</p><p>Even though Latin America still has a ways to go to increase the opportunities for women in tech, the region has taken steps in the right direction. A lot has been said about the next great company coming from somewhere outside of the U.S. I’d also put my money on it not being founded by a man.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/722721/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RphBtk1YkCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/latin-american-women-work-to-break-barrier-to-entry-in-tech/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Users loved sharing silly photos and videos that deleted themselves a few seconds after being received.</p><p>We heard Facebook made attempts to buy the small startup, but the team wanted to stay independent. That&#8217;s when Facebook and Zuckerberg went into hacker mode. With just a few weeks until Apple stopped accepting submissions of new apps before Christmas, it would take a sprint to get Poke built in time.</p><p></p><p>So a small squad led by Facebook Director Of Product Blake Ross kicked development into high gear, Zuckerberg lent a hand with the programming, and Facebook just made the deadline and launched the Poke app this morning.</p><p>But why would Ross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">publicly post to Facebook</a> that the team built the app in just 12 days? Maybe to show that it could. The message to Facebook&#8217;s competitors, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/38501585852/12-days\">MG Siegler writes</a>, is that if you don&#8217;t join Facebook, it can clone your app and compete with you at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p><p>And to top engineers, designers, and product visionaries, the moral of the Poke is that Facebook isn&#8217;t a traditional company restricted by red tape. Things get done fast at 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park. You could work for a tech company where it might take years for your product to ship. Or you could work at Facebook where two weeks later up to a billion people could be using what you built.</p><p><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id588594730\">Download Poke for iOS here</a></em></p><p><em>[Image Credit: Paul Sakuma/AP]</em></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725515/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ds1tDIOJpgk:AVNVNNCj2Hg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Ds1tDIOJpgk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/mark-zuckerberg-voice-of-poke/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Boogers*</a>, we didn&#8217;t believe it.</p><p>That&#8217;s not the TechCrunch app, we said. It has to be a clone. The logo is different, we said. Our COO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ned-desmond\">Ned Desmond</a> even downloaded a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tapjoy.com/\">Tapjoy</a> game and started playing it, just to prove it wasn&#8217;t the real TechCrunch app being offered up for fewer Premium Play credits than Bubble Safari.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not TechCrunch&#8217;s practice to pay for downloads or any traffic,&#8221; our Director of Product <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ccying\">Christine Ying</a> insisted when I asked her if she knew why our legit mobile app was hanging out with the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/big-win-slots/id468559262?mt=8\">Big Win Slots</a> in all of its desperate splendor in the middle of Draw Something Free! (or insert other lame mobile game here).</p><p>Finally, our COO got to Level 5 of Goobers Vs. Boogers or whatever, and we discovered that it was indeed the TechCrunch app being pushed upon innocent social mobile gamers, all with the eventual goal of pushing these terrible terrible apps to the App Store Top Charts. This is sad.</p><p>Because, despite our impassioned doubts, we <em>were</em> actually complicit in this without our consent. As far as we can tell, Aol has some sort of deal with Tapjoy for its other apps (I dunno, MovieFone) and TechCrunch was rolled into it. Neither <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-eldon\">Eric Eldon</a> or I or anyone else at TechCrunch were consulted about or aware of this decision, which is <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">not without precedent</a>. This pisses me off. Eldon is on vacation, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it would piss him off, too.</p><p>Because straight up paying for downloads, or traffic, to a blog is insidious and it makes users and readers wrinkle their noses when they read the phrase &#8220;paying for downloads.&#8221; And we are good enough that we don&#8217;t need to do it.</p><p>Despite, or even because of, the trolls, people love TechCrunch. If they&#8217;re not downloading our app, it&#8217;s probably because it crashes. I&#8217;ve read the reviews. As Christine pointed out earlier, TechCrunch has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">traditionally been against paying for traffic </a>(or downloads) of editorial content, because our content is actually interesting, and paid traffic tends to be very low quality. It&#8217;s our fault if the vehicle of that content is flawed to the point where people don&#8217;t want to use it, and paying people to do so doesn&#8217;t solve the problem.</p><p>So, since Michael raised a stink about it earlier, our <del>occupying</del> parent company is trying to pull us from whatever this deal is &#8212; to its credit. But, just TechCrunch as far as we know.</p><p>This is also sad. Why not pull all the Aol properties from Tapjoy, whatever they are? Why just one? Tapjoy is spammy and scuzzy and exists to game Apple&#8217;s top App Store rankings for apps that are probably not worth downloading. Otherwise, why would those apps be paying people to? In fact, Apple itself <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/11/apple-stomps-on-tapjoys-app-download-circle-jerk-again/\">has cracked down</a> on Tapjoy since it became aware of its practices. If they (Aol) pull a deal in one case (us) because of this principle, they should pull in all of them. Why make an exception?</p><p>Since we&#8217;ve investigated this, we&#8217;ve also been made aware that Aol pays for Google Ads on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/events/crunchies-2012/event-info-2/\">The Crunchies</a>, but that sort of sits better with me, at least, because that event is very clearly defined as a revenue opportunity. People can buy tickets through those links, and the ads aren&#8217;t being used to artificially puff up our traffic numbers.</p><p>Aol and/or our business side may think it&#8217;s smart to extend these sorts of lame practices over to editorial content without telling us or asking for our input, but we don&#8217;t. And until they stop, we&#8217;re going to make fun of them, just like we would have in junior high. With all due respect, of course.</p><p><em>*<strong>Note:</strong> Goobers Vs.

We believe technology can help solve some of the world&#8217;s most pressing challenges, and we back innovators who are using tech in clever ways to bring transformational impact at scale. Technology has exploded progress across business, information and science &#8212; we need to see that leap frog innovation in the social impact sector. Over the years we&#8217;ve heard from various partners that what sets us apart is our willingness to fund new breakthrough ideas and to take informed risk. We launched Global Impact Awards to help spur innovation and contribute to the movement toward more data-driven philanthropy.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/2QFPSY9JgNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p><strong>What are some of the things you&#8217;ve done in the past to help bring awareness to important needs and events?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/the-weekly-good-googles-director-of-giving-discusses-global-concerns-and-action/0c8f52a/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725458\"></a>We were shocked to learn that more people are enslaved today than at any other point in human history. Think about that. What&#8217;s more critical than having your own freedom? So last year we provided over $11 million in grants to address the issue of human trafficking and slavery. Our support helped to free thousands of people and is keeping millions more from ever falling victim to this horrible crime. We&#8217;re seeing a lot more attention to this issue from governments, nonprofits and the media. And that type of awareness is key to fighting a problem like slavery.</p><p><strong>What are your long-term goals as a company to keep trying to help push the world &#8220;forward&#8221; for good?</strong></p><p>From the very beginning, Larry and Sergey have talked about using technology and innovation to drive ambitious social impact. That&#8217;s pretty unconventional for a company, and we hold ourselves to a high standard for how we can do that. Google engineers develop products such as Public Alerts through Crisis Response or Flu Trends. We have programs for free and discounted ads and apps for nonprofits. My team&#8217;s goal is to encourage innovation in the social impact sector.</p><p><strong>Can you share an anecdote about how something Google has done has affected or benefited someone directly?</strong></p><p>One of our grantees, Samasource, is working in Africa, South Asia and other marginalized areas to bring paid work to people in need. Last year with our support they helped over 2,000 people escape poverty through computer-based microwork. One young woman in Kenya started out in the Samasource center and moved on to start an NGO to stop gender-based violence in universities. She used the income generated from her Samasource assignments to start that organization.</p><p><strong>How long has Google done this?</strong></p><p>Giving back and supporting innovation has been a core part of Google&#8217;s culture since the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Do you have plans for any hackathons with a focus on helping people?</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve done a few &#8216;develop for good&#8217; hackathons in the past, and have received submissions for how to tackle issues in sustainability, illicit networks and citizen engagement. We&#8217;ve found that engineers are really eager to put their tech skills to good use and have important insights to offer nonprofits for how they can be more data-oriented. We&#8217;re looking to do more hackathons in the future, so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s the most difficult part of trying to do things &#8220;for good&#8221;? Do you get a lot of presentations and pleas for help sent your way?</strong></p><p>We don&#8217;t accept unsolicited proposals for the Global Impact Awards, but our team works through hundreds of ideas sourced from Googlers. We also do proactive analyses of various issues and potential solutions. For me, I think the biggest challenge is that no amount of money can be thrown at these types of problems to make them go away in a night. There&#8217;s always a need for incremental aid that will pull at the heart strings and that&#8217;s hard. But while it may not be as sexy, we think funding tech and innovation is the best way for Google to help drive transformational impact at scale.</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><p>It&#8217;s extremely important that large companies like Google are participating in nonprofit activities that benefit the greater good of the world. Facebook has done this on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=8925133\">multiple occasions</a>, with its CEO <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/24/techcrunch-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-on-100-million-education-donation/\">Mark Zuckerberg leading the way</a>.</p><p>All tech companies can participate, even individual developers, marketers and executives.

Here are some of the more noteworthy improvements:</p><p><strong>Mobile Services:</strong> Better capability to schedule background jobs so the user experience doesn&#8217;t get disrupted. Jobs can be scheduled on pre-set time intervals, allowing the developer to perform scenarios without creating or managing a separate virtual machine. In addition, Azure mobile services are now available in Northern Europe. Previously, Windows Azure Mobile Services was only supported in the US East and US West regions of Windows Azure.</p><p><strong>Website Scaling:</strong> Developers can now scale websites to six shared instances and up to 10 reserved instances. These can be small, medium or large in size. Previously, a developer could only scale to three shared instances and three reserved ones. Guthrie also writes that Azure now has a new custom create workflow that allows for the configuration of source control settings as part of the site creation.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/windows-azure-gets-more-competitive-with-aws-launches-new-mobile-features-website-scaling-data-sync-and-more/createwebsiteazure/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725391\"></a></p><p><strong>Data Sync:</strong> SQL Data Sync Services are now available from within the new Windows Azure Management Portal. Guthrie explains that SQL Data Sync lets you synchronize data between multiple SQL databases. These SQL databases can span across your on-premises environment and the cloud, or across multiple cloud-hosted databases that might include multiple Windows Azure regions around the world.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the full list of what&#8217;s available:</p><ul><li>Mobile Services (job scheduler support, Europe Region Support, Command Line Support)</li><li>Web Sites (scale improvements, integrated source control)</li><li>SQL Data Sync (support in the new HTML portal)</li><li>ACS Management (support in the new HTML portal)</li><li>Media Services (job and task management, blob storage support, reserved compute)</li><li>Virtual Network enhancements</li><li>Subscription Filtering Support</li><li>Windows Azure Store (now available in more countries)</li></ul><p>There have been a number of recent updates to Windows Azure, which illustrates that it trying to be more competitive with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure is still a ways from being a true challenger but it has continually been adding new features that shows that it is intent on closing the gap.</p><p>Earlier this month, the team reported that a developer can do automatic push updates for <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/a-sign-of-more-openness-windows-azure-mobile-services-adds-push-notification-for-ios/\">iOS mobile apps</a>. It also announced a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/windows-azure-storage-drops-pricing-by-as-much-as-28-in-price-fight-for-market-share/\">drop in price for storage</a>. Earlier this week <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/17/forrester-report-shows-amazon-aws-reigns-supreme-with-developers-as-windows-azure-gains-momentum/\">Forrester Research</a> reported that Azure is second in popularity with developers to AWS. It&#8217;s still far behind Amazon Web Services, but the Azure team is showing it has credibility with developers. That&#8217;s a big deal, showing that a community is indeed emerging on the Azure cloud.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725359/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NVkHDBSQS7s:pi43HVUwDaA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/NVkHDBSQS7s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/windows-azure-gets-more-competitive-with-aws-launches-new-mobile-features-website-scaling-data-sync-and-more/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The new money will allow Steamboat &#8212; and by extension, Disney &#8212; to continue making investments in digital media, as the market continues to heat up.</p><p>Like other investment portfolios linked to major media conglomerates, Steamboat tends to makes strategic investments in startups that focus on digital video, gaming, and advertising &#8212; basically all things that could facilitate Disney&#8217;s embrace of digital media. Example companies in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://steamboatvc.com/portfolio.php?country=us&amp;language=en&amp;list=list\">its portfolio</a> include content-delivery network Edgecast Networks, encoding technology provider Elemental Technologies, online ad startup FreeWheel, and portable camera maker GoPro, all of which seem to be doing fairly well.</p><p>The firm has had its share of successes, such as Playdom, which was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/playdom-acquired-by-disney-for-up-to-763-2-million/\">bought by Disney</a> for more than $750 million in 2010, as well as Pure Digital (acquired by Cisco) and GreyStripe (bought by ValueClick). But not all exits have been totally successful &#8212; Move Networks was sold to Dish in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/is-move-networks-trying-to-pull-a-veoh/\">what appeared to be a fire sale</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, now seems to be a good time to be investing in digital media, particularly online video and technologies that help support it. With YouTube emerging as a viable platform for video distribution and monetization, the promise of alternative online video content sources looks like it&#8217;s finally being realized.</p><p>Meanwhile, a ton of traditional media companies &#8212; like Disney &#8212; are moving their video and gaming portfolios to new platforms to take advantage of new online, social, and mobile distribution outlets. With the new fund in place, Steamboat will be there to continue to invest in the technology companies that will make those new business models work.</p><p>We were not able to reach representatives from Steamboat at press time, but will update if we hear back!</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725374/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=NLp7O_mG5ns:I1UtI2nkePs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/NLp7O_mG5ns\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/steamboat-ventures-85m-fund/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Instagram was acquired after Facebook began developing the Camera app, and it&#8217;s widely believed that Facebook dropped the Facebook login requirement for Messenger to compete with popular messaging service WhatsApp. This summer, Dalton Caldwell wrote a widely discussed letter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daltoncaldwell.com/dear-mark-zuckerberg/\">&#8220;Dear Mark Zuckerberg,&#8221;</a> chronicling his experience with Facebook&#8217;s aggressive Merger &amp; Acquisitions tactics.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/snapchat-co-founder-evan-spiegel-responds-to-poke-welcome-facebook-seriously/poke-vs-snapchat3-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725363\"></a></p><p>Given that Snapchat is in the process of raising a major funding round, the timing of Poke is very interesting. On the one hand, having the world&#8217;s largest social network copy your app and onboard users across its mobile apps with much larger user bases could limit Snapchat&#8217;s growth significantly.</p><p>On the other, Poke certainly validates this space as more than a place for sexters and high school and college kids.</p><p>And just because Facebook built its own app doesn&#8217;t mean it still wouldn&#8217;t be interested in an acquisition.

We&#8217;re familiar with the prompts within the status box when we log into Facebook and sit on our news feed. Today, I noticed something different. It asked me, by name, what was going on. We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for comment, but these are the types of design and user experience tests that we see in the wild all of the time.

Sure, it&#8217;s a social network, but when your friends&#8217; content is surrounded by ads all of the time, you tend to lose that personal touch. Having said that, the more items that are shared, the more you&#8217;ll come back to the site and to more opportunities for Facebook ads. Have you seen this on Facebook?

It came back better than ever, Jawbone said, and for the most part that seems to be true. Flaky syncing used to mar my original, even though I never experienced the same cataclysmic failure as others. This time around, I noticed a problem initially that others in the office have also seen, and a few other users are already reporting: a matte finish on the end cap that&#8217;s prone to peeling. It looks cheap.</p><p>Two of our staff units are exhibiting this already, both after just a few days&#8217; use. And we&#8217;ve also found a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/unravel101/status/279809494039535617\">report on Twitter</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/TROUBLESHOOTING/Coating-peeling-off/m-p/48794\">someone else complaining of the same thing</a> on Jawbone&#8217;s official forums. Two suggested fixes from that thread: don&#8217;t ever remove your Jawbone UP (lol), and buy the three-pack replacement caps that Jawbone offers in its official store. Both are obviously less than ideal. An ideal solution would be this not happening to begin with.</p><p>The cap complaints are echoed by a number of people in the Jawbone forums on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/WELCOME/Cap-issues-with-new-Jawbone-Up/m-p/48282\">other threads</a>, and also include users complaining of caps that come loose during vigorous activity. This was an issue with the original version, and one reportedly made better with version two. Jawbone says your first replacement cap is free, but after that, you have to go through the store and purchase new ones. Presumably, that won&#8217;t make them any more resistant to this flaking issue, too.</p><p>These Jawbone UP&#8217;s may not be dying permanently at random, and sure, the issue is mostly cosmetic, but the Up is $130: at that price, you&#8217;re not expecting it to start showing wear from normal use 48 hours after you crack the packaging. We&#8217;ve reached out to Jawbone looking for an explanation, but in the meantime let us know if you&#8217;re seeing this issue, or any other problems with your UP wristband.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/jawbone-band-bad.jpg\"></a></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725235/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/n0jbQ-S4ayU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/jawbone-up-users-how-is-your-end-cap-holding-up/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook and are waiting to see what Facebook puts on the now-empty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/397568030328686/\">Poke support page</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/poke-vs-snapchat3.png\"></a></p><p>If it&#8217;s in keeping with the Facebook <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\">Terms Of Service</a>, Facebook likely gets to hold on to that content for a period of time before it&#8217;s deleted. This is what Facebook&#8217;s TOS says about your content when it&#8217;s destroyed:</p><blockquote><p>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p></blockquote><p>The social network may have to develop some new language for this app, as opposed to having all of Facebook&#8217;s products fall under the same terms of service. In fact, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/\">Josh Constine</a> has learned that Facebook may actually be completely deleting photos from its servers or is at least making them completely inaccessible to users and employees. We&#8217;ll wait for confirmation on that.</p><p>In either case, Facebook gives users the option to clear their inbox so any unread messages are instantly destroyed.</p><p>Snapchat&#8217;s method is to delete the image from its servers as soon as the recipient has seen it.</p><p>A second, and important, difference is the way Snapchat and Poke connect you to friends.</p><p>Snapchat uses Facebook to find friends, and obviously Poke does the same, so Poke has a leg up in terms of auto-integration. Still, Snapchat may help you actually find more friends with the app, as you can search by phone number or user name to add friends.</p><p>It&#8217;s also worth considering Snapchat&#8217;s username customization. The app has a loyal base of users with <em>chosen</em> screen names. That could be one of the bigger differences between Snapchat and Facebook Poke.</p><p>When you download Poke on a mobile device, you instantly log in with your Facebook Profile, relegating you to the name you use on Facebook and the friends you have there.</p><p>Though I don&#8217;t believe in the slightest that Snapchat is used primarily for sexting, I do think that there may be some users who enjoy snapping with randos (as evidenced by Twitter) that would like to keep their anonymous user name.</p><p>Poke also has two extra forms of interaction: text-only messages and &#8220;pokes.&#8221;</p><p>Both let you overlay text onto photos, and both let you draw over photos in a selection of colors (if we&#8217;re getting picky, Snapchat has more color options for drawing).</p><p>After you&#8217;ve taken your picture (or video) and added your text and artwork, both apps let you set a limit on how long the content will be viewable to the recipient. On Poke, the second limit is a choice between 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds, whereas Snapchat lets you choose anywhere between 1 and 10 seconds.</p><p>The actual feature differences are slight, but it&#8217;ll be interesting to watch this space take off now that Facebook has thrown its hat in the ring.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1.jpg\"></a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/2.jpg\"></a></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725249/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=l9T3s7SdK4k:A-pONPJ24tU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/l9T3s7SdK4k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-vs-snapchat-what-is-the-difference/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The API, which was announced at Google I/O in June, could pave the way for more interesting video-related apps that leverage YouTube videos.</p><p>With the launch of the new Android API, developers will now be able to embed high-quality videos to their apps without having to leverage YouTube&#8217;s WebView implementation. For apps on Android, that means no more iframes. It also means that developers will have a much richer suite of available actions and features that they&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of.</p><p>Available for apps on Froyo devices or later, the API provides access to full-screen video and orientation change support, as well as closed-caption display, support for YouTube ads, and direct access to the Android YouTube app. While being launched on an experimental basis, the API will drastically improve the experience for users tuning in to videos on Android apps.</p><p>Earlier today, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/9x9-tv/\">I bemoaned the lack of Android apps</a> which support video discovery and native YouTube embeds while writing about 9&#215;9.tv. Indeed, that app is one of the first to take advantage of the new API, providing a new form of video discovery for Android users. Soundtracking &#8212; which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/soundtracking-for-android/\">Josh wrote about yesterday</a> &#8212; is also leveraging the new API to provide some new, Android-only features. In addition, Buzzfeed and Flipboard are taking advantage of the new API, building YouTube videos directly into their Android apps.</p><p>We can expect more apps to emerge on Android devices that take advantage of these capabilities. We&#8217;re also likely to see the emergence of more cross-platform capabilities from existing apps that today only work on iOS devices. For Google, it&#8217;s one way to help boost development for Android, while also improving the quality of experience for YouTube viewers in non-YouTube apps.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725269/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=UqAZUnazECQ:KbylgE_kxyk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/UqAZUnazECQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/youtube-android-api/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Head of Product Amanda McConnell and Chief Technology Officer Alain Avakian gave me a preview of the redesign last week.

With this approach, when Rent.com rolls out new features, it can immediately push those changes to its visitors on all devices. Plus, a lot of Rent.com&#8217;s traffic comes from search, and it&#8217;s better to give mobile visitors who arrive that way a mobile-optimized web experience, rather than forcing them to download an app.</p><p>Mobile traffic now accounts for 25 to 30 percent of Rent.com&#8217;s traffic, Avakian said, and he expects it to go as high as 40 percent in the next few years. At the same time, McConnell said that with 3 million unique monthly visitors, the site can&#8217;t be quite as experimental as a startup: &#8220;We have to be a little bit more startegic how we&#8217;re going to be making changes.&#8221; So the new design is only available to select users for now, with plans to make it fully available by the end of the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>Other changes in the redesign include the ability to search for listings nearby, a new grid view and map view for browsing search results, and the ability for renters to track their activity on the site, so they can save their favorite properties for viewing later.</p><p>And while this isn&#8217;t directly related to the redesign, Avakian also pointed out that Rent.com has a different business model than most apartment listing sites: it only gets paid when the property owner actually finds a renter, so &#8220;we optimize our site for driving renters to find that right apartment.&#8221;</p><p>Rent.com says it worked with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.filamentgroup.com\">Filament Group</a> to create the new design.

And it doesn&#8217;t look like CommerceInterface, headquartered in Salt Lake City and operational since 2007, had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/commerceinterface\">raised any significant funds</a> from outside investors previously.</p><p>Groupon had already been using CommerceInterface in its own Groupon Goods operations since April of this year, it said in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://investor.groupon.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=728531\">release</a>. Groupon Goods is a bit of a soup-to-nuts effort: it&#8217;s a platform for different merchants to post sales of diamond jewellery and designer sunglasses, but also mattresses, computers and cutlery. So this could be a matter of the company wanting to better integrate the service as it continues to build up that business, which as of Q3 was on a run rate of $1.5 billion in global billings.

You could see something like CommerceInterface sitting as part of a wider service portfolio that Groupon offers to merchants as a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for all their e-e-commerce needs. Groupon has made a number of other acquisitions that you could put into the category of B2B IT services, including its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/groupon-picks-up-breadcrumb-for-a-little-pos-magic/\">Breadcrumb point-of-sale buy earlier this year</a>. That app got an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/breadcrumb-app-expedites-operations-restaurant-183500972.html\">update</a> just earlier today.</p><p>But according to the release, this doesn&#8217;t look like it will be the case: &#8220;CommerceInterface will no longer service other retail channels and current customers will have the option to transition to other vendors over the next six months with migration support from the company,&#8221; the company says. That&#8217;s a missed opportunity, I think.</p><p>Full release below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Groupon Acquires Channel Management Provider CommerceInterface<br /></strong><br />
CHICAGO&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211; Groupon (<a href=\"http://www.groupon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.groupon.com</a>) (NASDAQ: GRPN) announced today it has acquired CommerceInterface (<a href=\"http://www.commerceinterface.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.commerceinterface.com</a>), a leading provider of web-based channel management technology that helps manufacturers, distributors and retailers succeed at managing their businesses and selling online. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>Groupon has used CommerceInterface technology since April 2012 to streamline operations of the growing Groupon Goods platform and automate interactions with thousands of existing vendors. The acquisition enables Groupon to leverage infrastructure provided by CommerceInterface to support and optimize the Groupon Goods business around the world in 2013.</p><p>&#8220;CommerceInterface has proven to be an important piece of Groupon Goods infrastructure in the U.S., quickly and reliably streamlining the execution of orders and other vendor interactions,&#8221; said Faisal Masud, head of Groupon Goods. &#8220;We look forward to enhancing our abilities to better support merchants overseas beginning early next year.&#8221;</p><p>CommerceInterface will no longer service other retail channels and current customers will have the option to transition to other vendors over the next six months with migration support from the company.</p><p>In Q3 2012, Groupon Goods reached an annual run rate of nearly $1.5 billion in global billings. A wide variety of high quality inventory is featured, from diamond jewelry and designer sunglasses to mattresses, computer tablets, 3D HD televisions and the giant radio-controlled flying shark.

These apps also increasingly are launching on iOS devices first, with the occasional Android implementation popping up after the fact.</p><p>The latest app in the video discovery segment &#8212; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.9x9.tv/\">9&#215;9.tv</a> &#8212; bucks both of those trends: It sorts online videos not based on overall popularity or trending or affinity on social networks. And, well, it provides some video discovery love for Android tablet owners, who have long been neglected by anyone doing much in this space.</p><p>The app provides curated channels of video that are designed to mimic viewing habits of regular TV viewers. It does this by breaking videos down into various categories and showing just the most appropriate nine channels based on the time of day. It calls that &#8220;day parting,&#8221; providing morning shows in the morning and late-night clips at late-night and primetime content in primetime. The idea is to make online video viewing kind of more like the way people watch TV.</p><p>Along those lines, the app also allows users to connect devices &#8212; like for instance, connecting your 7&#8243; tablet to a bigger 10&#8243; inch tablet (silly, I know), or connecting to an Android-powered connected TV device. That will allow you to browse and navigate videos on the device in your hand, and send them to be watched on the bigger screen.</p><p>Viewers will get a continuous feed of videos that they can watch, kind of like TV. Those videos will be curated by time of day and personalized based on the channels that users tend to enjoy watching. But since no one&#8217;s perfect, and inevitably users will want to watch something else every now and then, they can also through channels and videos by just swiping back and forth with the power of their index fingers, magically powering a shift in what they&#8217;re watching.</p><p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re one of those people with an Android device and can&#8217;t figure out what type of video to watch, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.tv9x9.player&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsInR2LnR2OXg5LnBsYXllciJd\">download it from the Google Play store</a> and try it out.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725165/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZGzosJEnz2A:bktgnUKbwz8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ZGzosJEnz2A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/9x9-tv/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The launch confirms <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20121216/facebook-to-launch-its-own-snapchat-competitor-app/\">AllThingsD&#8217;s report</a> from earlier this month. Poke is a big move into the ephemeral messaging space for Facebook, and it could give it even more data on who your closest friends are.</p><p>Facebook was convinced it needed an expiring messages app. Snapchat&#8217;s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&amp;hl=en\">Android apps</a> were gaining serious traction with young users. Over 50 million photos are getting shared on Snapchat each day for a total of 1 billion traded on the service compared to Facebook&#8217;s 300 million photos shared a day. Clearly there was something magical about self-destructing media.</p><p>Seems that Facebook didn&#8217;t want to wait for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a> to get so big it&#8217;d have to make another costly acquisition like Instagram and instead decided to compete early. We heard rumors that it had made overtures about acquiring Snapchat, but when the founders decided to stay independent, Facebook built its own version in just 12 days. Why would Facebook&#8217;s Blake Ross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">share</a> that fact? Beacause it&#8217;s that kind of tenacity and lack of red tape that attracts great talent to come work at Facebook. It&#8217;s also a signal to startups about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/38501585852/12-days\">just how fast Facebook can steamroll them</a>.</p><h4>How Do You Poke?</h4><p>The Poke app brings the classic contentless message into the mobile media-sharing age, but it&#8217;s actually a completely separate feature. Facebook explains that the app is designed to let you contact friends from wherever you are and show them what you&#8217;re doing. Here&#8217;s how the announcement describes how the app works:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you&#8217;re up to in a lightweight way. You can poke an individual friend or several at once. Each message expires after a specific time you&#8217;ve set, either 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When time runs out, the message disappears from the app. &#8220;</em></p></blockquote><p>Essentially you pick a type of message to send &#8212; either a poke, text, photo, or video &#8212; and choose a friend or multiple friends to send it to. You can then set the expiration timer, add a location, overlay text or draw on a photo, and then send it. Recipients get a push notification with a little voice saying &#8220;Poke!&#8221;, open the Poke app, see your name and what type of message you sent, and then hold down on the message thread to view the content until the timer runs out and the message disappears.</p><p>The app is all mobile and completely separate from Facebook&#8217;s other apps and desktop site. If you Poke someone on Facebook.com by going to their profile, they won&#8217;t get that Poke in the App, and nothing you do in the app can be seen outside of it. There&#8217;s currently no way to view Poke app messages on the web.</p><p>For now the Poke app is iOS only, but you can expect a release for Android soon as Snapchat is already there. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">Poke was built in under two weeks</a> by a small team led Facebook&#8217;s veteran Director of Product Blake Ross, so there&#8217;s probably a lot of development still left to get it where Facebook wants it to be. There&#8217;s a chance that self-destructing media could make its way into Facebook&#8217;s main app, as the company has said that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/09/standalone-guinea-pigs/\">power users of its standalone apps like Camera and Messenger are guinea pigs</a> for features it&#8217;s considering for the flagship apps.</p><p>As for privacy, Poke simply links back to the main Facebook terms of service, which would imply Facebook can save all the content from the app until you delete your account. However, a Facebook spokesperson tells me &#8220;All Poke messages are retained for two days after being read, to help facilitate abuse reporting.&#8221; This implies photos are deleted after that. The statement references the fact that users can flag messages as inappropriate if they&#8217;re getting nude or otherwise alarming Pokes. Facebook also gives paranoid Pokers have the option to clear their inbox so any unread messages are instantly destroyed.</p><h4>A Poke To The Gut For Snapchat</h4><p>Poke is pretty unabashed clone of Snapchat. Both apps let you draw and overlay text on photos before you send the little timebombs. They also notify the person you&#8217;re chatting with if you take a screenshot of what they sent you. For a quick reference, check out this <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-vs-snapchat-what-is-the-difference/\">chart comparing the features of the two apps</a>.</p><p>Poke adds some useful extras. It offers simple text messages, in addition to video and photos. You can add a location to where you record a Poke message. Also, in Poke you can have group conversations, whereas on Snapchat you can message multiple people at once but not keep them all in a thread.</p><p>One thing Poke does lack is the ability to message people in your phone book, not just Facebook friends. In terms of design, Poke&#8217;s biggest flaw right now is a slight delay from when you hold on a message to when the content appears and the timer starts ticking. This caused me to lift my finger to try tapping again, canceling the previous view. Snapchat&#8217;s quickness is highly revered by its users, and Facebook will have make Poke more responsive, but otherwise the app feels well crafted.</p><p>Poke is a big problem for Snapchat, which is unfortunate for the small, scrappy team out of Stanford. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">GigaOm reported</a> Snapchat is in the middle of closing a big round of funding led by Benchmark Capital, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">our sources</a> indicate it&#8217;s raising over $10 million at a $70 million valuation. That value might fluctuate with Poke&#8217;s release. It certainly validates the space, but only by bringing an 800-pound blue gorilla into it. It seems Snapchat CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel see this as confirming his company is working on something important, as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/snapchat-co-founder-evan-spiegel-responds-to-poke-welcome-facebook-seriously/\">his response to the launch of Poke was &#8220;Welcome, Facebook. Seriously.&#8221;</a></p><p>Poke has some big advantages it will bring to the fight with Snapchat, most specifically in distribution. Facebook does some nifty things to onboard people. If someone else uses the Poke app to send you a message, but you haven&#8217;t installed Poke yet, you&#8217;ll get a push notification from you main Facebook app asking you to download Poke. Facebook also routinely cross-promotes its standalone apps with banners at the top of its primary apps. For example, a download button for Poke at the top of Facebook for iOS which has around 125 million users could drive tons of installs.</p><p>The question now is whether users will be comfortable sharing on Poke. Snapchat&#8217;s outsider status gave it some street cred, especially amongst teenagers who view Facebook as a tool of the generation before them. After Facebook&#8217;s privacy troubles over the years, some people don&#8217;t fully trust it.</p><p>If Snapchat actually was mainly a sexting app, it&#8217;d probably be fine despite Poke because people would be scared to intermingle racy photos with their widely accessible Facebook presence.. But it&#8217;s not all about sexting. Snapchat is mostly for sharing goofy photos that months or years later might seem inane but at the time are hilarious. Using Poke for a few minutes I already get the feeling it can handle this silly and addicting use case well. I&#8217;ve already gotten a few laughs out of it.</p><p>Poke could successfully slow the growth of Snapchat and deter others from entering the space, which would keep more sharing in the Facebook ecosystem. Inevitably the question is how Facebook will make money on Poke. Right now there&#8217;s no ads. One day there might be, but its launch seems more focused on creating something fun for users while boxing out a potential disruptor. Mark Zuckerberg pulled the rug out from under Myspace, and he doesn&#8217;t want anyone doing the same to him.</p><p>Even if it doesn&#8217;t earn money directly, Poke is very important to Facebook. The people you send ephemeral messages to are often your closest friends. Facebook needs to know this intimate social graph to be able to tune its news feed and other parts of the service to show you the most relevant content. Because really, if you send someone a photo of you with a purple mustaches drawn on top, you probably want to see what they&#8217;re sharing with everyone else.</p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/#gallery-725205-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a><p><em>You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id588594730\">download Poke from the App Store here</a>. </em></p><p><em>And there&#8217;s a cute little Easter Egg in it. If you drag your messages list all the way up, you&#8217;ll see the text &#8220;I&#8217;ll find something to put here&#8221;.

Or didn’t want anyone to know you had found it?</em>&#8221; [emphasis added]</p><p>While we each have our individual viewpoints, as a tech news organization, we have no intention to take a position on gun control (I swear, I can see validity in both sides of the debate). This post is about a colossally bad press conference, the NRA’s pathological inability to take other viewpoints seriously and, just perhaps, temper some of their own policies.</p><p>For starters, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Slate/status/282179391751086081\">Columbine high school had armed guards</a>. We also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cad.sagepub.com/content/58/2/222\">know that gun control laws</a> can reduce violence. Moreover, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/violent-video-games-do-cause-some-violence-but-censorship-wont-help/\">while video games may, indeed lead to more aggression</a> in small populations, its far from clear that censorship policies would stop killers from getting violent video games or that they&#8217;d be more peaceful without them. Last, there are many nations littered with violent media, yet don&#8217;t have nearly the homicide rate of the U.S.</p><p>Maybe more guns would help, maybe they wouldn&#8217;t. But, the NRA wasn&#8217;t exactly a pillar of thoughtfulness today.</p><p>Not surprisingly, much of Twitter is a mix of shock and humor.

They are a sign of how the company continues to ramp up its international profile, not an insignificant effort because of the various clones — two European competitors for example are 9Flats and the Rocket Internet-backed Wimdu — that are emerging to meet demand. There is still some way to go in getting a fully-international operation up and running. Airbnb says that the 200,000 properties on its books now range across 30,000 cities in 192 countries.</p><p>Adding in the ability to read and write reviews, meanwhile, seems like table stakes and to be honest, it’s surprising that it’s taken this long to incorporate them, especially since they’ve proved fairly central to the company’s business model: “Reviews are foundational to creating trust on Airbnb and we’ve seen these become increasingly important to driving repeat traffic to hosts,” the company says.</p><p>The Calendar addition, lastly, is really a move to improve Airbnb’s<br />

To better target weary travellers and innkeepers this holiday season and beyond, Airbnb is adding support for 18 more languages; the ability to add reviews; and calendar access.</p><p>All the updates bring the iOS app further in line with the company&#8217;s website, and will let Airbnb become a lot more useful to people on the go &#8212; which may often the case when you&#8217;re an Airbnb user.</p><p>The 18 new languages &#8212; including Malay, Turkish and Chinese &#8212; now bring the total number supported<br />
by the app up to 27. They are a sign of how the company continues to ramp up its international profile, not an insignificant effort because of the various clones &#8212; two European competitors for example are 9Flats and the Rocket Internet-backed Wimdu &#8212; that are emerging to meet demand. There is still some way to go in getting a fully-international operation up and running. Airbnb says that the 200,000 properties on its books now range across 30,000 cities in 192 countries.</p><p>Adding in the ability to read and write reviews, meanwhile, seems like table stakes and to be honest, it&#8217;s surprising that it&#8217;s taken this long to incorporate them, especially since they&#8217;ve proved fairly central to the company&#8217;s business model: &#8220;Reviews are foundational to creating trust on Airbnb and we&#8217;ve seen these become increasingly important to driving repeat traffic to hosts,&#8221; the company says.</p><p>The Calendar addition, lastly, is really a move to improve Airbnb&#8217;s<br />
dialog with hosts. The idea here is that hosts will now be able to check and update availability for a property directly from their mobile devices, which will make it easier for them to post and list days on the service.</p><p>We&#8217;ve contacted Airbnb for some details on how well they&#8217;ve fared to date with mobile app usage, and whether they can give us any indication of when they plan to update on other platforms &#8212; like Android.</p><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/img_1157/' title='IMG_1157'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/screen-shot-2012-12-21-at-2-15-58-pm/' title='airbnb screen shot intl'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/screen-shot-2012-12-21-at-1-57-33-pm/' title='airbnb comment ios'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/screen-shot-2012-12-21-at-2-16-29-pm/' title='Screen Shot 2012-12-21 at 2.16.29 PM'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/screen-shot-2012-12-21-at-1-58-58-pm/' title='airbnb ios rating'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/screen-shot-2012-12-22-at-12-18-58/' title='Screen Shot 2012-12-22 at 12.18.58'></a><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725549/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ZhF9s1yHLUM:xgFZliNOvY8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ZhF9s1yHLUM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/airbnb-gets-more-international-and-interactive-adds-18-languages-reviews-and-calendar-access-in-new-app-update/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

A: Yes and no.</p><p>A lot has been written about the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/i-see-a-glass-thats-twice-as-big-as-it-needs-to-be/\">Series A crunch/palpable chill in Silicon Valley</a> that’s making founders pull their cardigans a little closer. Most recently a report by a venture capital analysis firm CB Insights suggests there hasn’t actually been a reduction in the amount of money available, but rather too much seed funding causing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/study-more-than-1000-seed-funded-startups-are-destined-to-be-orphaned-at-the-series-a-stage/\">too much demand for the same amount of cash</a> at the Series A level. Whichever way you cut it, a lot of U.S. seed-funded startups looking to upgrade their backing to Series A level are going to be going away with an empty begging bowl in the future.</p><p>But what about beyond the Valley? Does the funding situation in the U.S. have an impact on startup funding in Europe? As the old adage goes, if the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. So if Silicon Valley has a Series A chill, does that make the funding situation a little less forgiving for Europe’s seed-funded startups too? I asked several European VCs and investors for their views on whether the Series A situation in the U.S. is making life more difficult for startups in Europe. I’m not making any claims that this is a scientific poll — it’s a very small sample — but, nonetheless, it’s an interesting snapshot of opinion in the European investor community as 2012 draws to a close.</p><p>My takeaway from the poll is that while this group of European investors hold slightly differing views on how much influence the Valley has on the funding situation in Europe, they tend to fall into two camps on the Series A crunch: those that say there’s no change in Europe because it’s always been tough raising a Series A round here; and those that say Europe is having its own mini seed-funding boom — which means that getting a Series A is probably going to be even tougher in the future thanks to increased competition. Sucks to be a European startup then — but if you do manage to get Series A, rest assured you worked your ass off to get it (and probably deserve it).</p><p>Angel investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://card.biz/jberrebi\">Jeremie Berrebi</a>, who co-founded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kima-ventures\">KimaVentures</a>, says the U.S. Series A situation makes no difference to startup life in Europe. “The answer is simple: It was always difficult to raise Series A money in Europe…and it’s still difficult   No change!” he says in an email. Berrebi’s view is that the key to raising a round in Europe is still a sound business model. “What I can say is that almost all of our startups proving that they have a real business model and a good team are raising easily and successfully a round in Europe.”</p><p>Berrebi’s view echoes a sentiment expressed recently by Jackson Hull, previously VP of Plum District and now relocated from the West Coast to London as CTO of UK startup onefinestay. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/29/londons-onefinestay-nabs-plum-district-vp-jackson-hull-file-it-under-silicon-valley-comes-to-london-for-the-realism/\">Discussing the relative merits of London’s startup scene vs. the Valley</a> last month, he told me: “Businesses here in London, startup businesses, often have a firmer footing in terms of their business models… There’s actually a little bit of craziness in Silicon Valley in relation to startup ideas and the amount of capital being thrown behind these startups, so [US tech folk relocating to London] could be… a reflection of the fact there are great opportunities in London with high growth potential and a lot less noise. There’s more of a focus on a sustainable business model for startups in London.”</p><p>Angel investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julianranger.wordpress.com/\">Julian Ranger</a>‘s take on Europe and the Series A situation is akin to Berrebi’s — he says: “Europe will remain as tough as ever as SV effects are limited on early funding here.” He also flagged up the importance of nailing down the business model — and points out that if a European startup is going to the U.S. for Series A then the key ingredients are a “good business model, a good team and reasonable valuation.” “If these hit the mark then you’ll have a good chance [of raising Series A in the U.S.]; if they don’t you won’t,” he says. “Same as anywhere really.”</p><p>Ranger also notes that since equivalent U.S. startups — at “same stage, same team capability, same prospects” — can be valued two to three times higher than European counterparts, this can lead European startups to assume they will get an “immediate uplift” in valuation if they take a trip over the pond. But that’s just “wrong thinking,” he argues. ”Maybe the crunch (which is being over-hyped) will help startups realise that,” he adds. “You go the U.S. for funds because you want to access their market, their contacts and their scale — valuation will be a by-product and should not be the rationale.”</p><p>For <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/robin-klein\">Robin Klein</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/index-ventures\">Index Ventures</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://the-accelerator.blogspot.co.uk/\">The Accelerator Group</a>, Europe’s Series A situation looks like a microcosm of goings on in the U.S. — because he says the region has also had its own, albeit not quite so frothy, seed-stage investment boom, as governments have jumped on the startup bandwagon. ”There has been a marked increase in seed-stage startup investing here, too. More angels, more mini funds, partly EIS  [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/eis/\">Enterprise Investment Scheme</a>] fuelled,” he tells TechCrunch. He believes Europe is therefore set for its own version of the too-many-seed-funded-startups Series A crunch — with investor sentiment also being influenced by chillier climes over in the Valley. ”The change in sentiment in the U.S. will affect sentiment here, too. It will become harder for companies to get Series A funding and smart seed investors should ensure that ‘runways’ are long enough to achieve the milestones necessary. Boards of startup companies should try to focus very clearly on defining these milestones and ensure that they are achieved.”</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/credo/our-team\">Ondřej Bartoš</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/\">Credo Ventures</a>, goes one further: there is already a Series A crunch in Europe that’s making it harder for seed-funded startups to get to the next funding level, he says: “Series A crunch is now a reality — and not just in the U.S., but we see clear signs (maybe not yet backed by statistics) of it in Europe as well. Today’s reality is that the chances of a startup with seed or angel funding to get venture financing are decreasing.” As to the cause, Bartoš also points to rapid growth in angel and seed deals — going so far as to describe it as “accelerator and angel investing hysteria.”</p><p>“As far as I am looking at the market, I think the reason is not that the amount of available venture funds is decreasing (well in Europe it never was too high), but that the number of angel and seed deals is rapidly growing. With all the accelerator and angel investing hysteria which we’re seeing, it is not too surprising that often the quality of the startups with seed funding is low. If that’s really the case, we should be happy for the Series A crunch as it shows the VCs are keeping their quality standards high – and raising VC is staying as tough as ever which should be the case — only the best ones should succeed.”</p><p>So it’s not that Credo Ventures has reduced the amount of Series A funding it is offering — it “still has more than half of the fund available”, says Bartoš — but as with the CB Insights report, the problem here is too many seed-funded startups chasing the same pot of funding (and too many “low quality” ones at that). “We like investing into startups with previous seed or angel funding and/or accelerator experience. On the other hand, none of it is a guarantee to get funding, and yet we’re seeing lots of low-quality startups with previous seed funding,” he adds.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/runa-capital\">Runa Capital</a> partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andre-bliznyuk/1/26/a47\">Andre Bliznyuk</a> also believes the level of funding on offer at Series A won’t change. “We expect that Runa itself will continue to invest in Series A rounds at the same pace as before,” he says. So the key to unlocking that crucial Series A round is still both as simple and as hard as ever: basically, be an awesome startup. “We continue to believe that the strongest teams with the best products will continue to be able to raise financing, be it in Russia, Europe or the U.S.,” he adds. On a side note, Bliznyuk suggests that being an enterprise/B2B startup may increase the odds in your startup’s favour as that portion of the market has historically been less crowded than the consumer space. “We have also historically been more focused on enterprise/B2B software companies vs. consumer Internet startups, so our portfolio has largely been unaffected by the overall market exuberance,” he adds.</p><p>[Image by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/\">BlatantWorld.com</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/5054527234/sizes/m/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>]</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723945/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/g5km-aRS0h8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/g5km-aRS0h8/" (20693 37556) old 5 nil nil ((title nil "From Silicon Valley To Europe: Is The U.S. Series A Crunch Affecting European Startups?")

Sucks to be a European startup then &#8212; but if you do manage to get Series A, rest assured you worked your ass off to get it (and probably deserve it).</p><p>Angel investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://card.biz/jberrebi\">Jeremie Berrebi</a>, who co-founded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kima-ventures\">KimaVentures</a>, says the U.S. Series A situation makes no difference to startup life in Europe. &#8220;The answer is simple: It was always difficult to raise Series A money in Europe&#8230;and it&#8217;s still difficult   No change!&#8221; he says in an email. Berrebi&#8217;s view is that the key to raising a round in Europe is still a sound business model. &#8220;What I can say is that almost all of our startups proving that they have a real business model and a good team are raising easily and successfully a round in Europe.&#8221;</p><p>Berrebi&#8217;s view echoes a sentiment expressed recently by Jackson Hull, previously VP of Plum District and now relocated from the West Coast to London as CTO of UK startup onefinestay. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/29/londons-onefinestay-nabs-plum-district-vp-jackson-hull-file-it-under-silicon-valley-comes-to-london-for-the-realism/\">Discussing the relative merits of London&#8217;s startup scene vs. the Valley</a> last month, he told me: “Businesses here in London, startup businesses, often have a firmer footing in terms of their business models&#8230; There’s actually a little bit of craziness in Silicon Valley in relation to startup ideas and the amount of capital being thrown behind these startups, so [US tech folk relocating to London] could be… a reflection of the fact there are great opportunities in London with high growth potential and a lot less noise. There’s more of a focus on a sustainable business model for startups in London.”</p><p>Angel investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julianranger.wordpress.com/\">Julian Ranger</a>&#8216;s take on Europe and the Series A situation is akin to Berrebi&#8217;s &#8212; he says: &#8220;Europe will remain as tough as ever as SV effects are limited on early funding here.&#8221; He also flagged up the importance of nailing down the business model &#8212; and points out that if a European startup is going to the U.S. for Series A then the key ingredients are a &#8220;good business model, a good team and reasonable valuation.&#8221; &#8220;If these hit the mark then you&#8217;ll have a good chance [of raising Series A in the U.S.]; if they don&#8217;t you won&#8217;t,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Same as anywhere really.&#8221;</p><p>Ranger also notes that since equivalent U.S. startups &#8212; at &#8220;same stage, same team capability, same prospects&#8221; &#8212; can be valued two to three times higher than European counterparts, this can lead European startups to assume they will get an &#8220;immediate uplift&#8221; in valuation if they take a trip over the pond. But that&#8217;s just &#8220;wrong thinking,&#8221; he argues. &#8221;Maybe the crunch (which is being over-hyped) will help startups realise that,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;You go the U.S. for funds because you want to access their market, their contacts and their scale &#8212; valuation will be a by-product and should not be the rationale.&#8221;</p><p>For <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/robin-klein\">Robin Klein</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/index-ventures\">Index Ventures</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://the-accelerator.blogspot.co.uk/\">The Accelerator Group</a>, Europe&#8217;s Series A situation looks like a microcosm of goings on in the U.S. &#8212; because he says the region has also had its own, albeit not quite so frothy, seed-stage investment boom, as governments have jumped on the startup bandwagon. &#8221;There has been a marked increase in seed-stage startup investing here, too. More angels, more mini funds, partly EIS  [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/eis/\">Enterprise Investment Scheme</a>] fuelled,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. He believes Europe is therefore set for its own version of the too-many-seed-funded-startups Series A crunch &#8212; with investor sentiment also being influenced by chillier climes over in the Valley. &#8221;The change in sentiment in the U.S. will affect sentiment here, too. It will become harder for companies to get Series A funding and smart seed investors should ensure that &#8216;runways&#8217; are long enough to achieve the milestones necessary. Boards of startup companies should try to focus very clearly on defining these milestones and ensure that they are achieved.&#8221;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/credo/our-team\">Ondřej Bartoš</a>, partner at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/\">Credo Ventures</a>, goes one further: there is already a Series A crunch in Europe that&#8217;s making it harder for seed-funded startups to get to the next funding level, he says: &#8220;Series A crunch is now a reality &#8212; and not just in the U.S., but we see clear signs (maybe not yet backed by statistics) of it in Europe as well. Today&#8217;s reality is that the chances of a startup with seed or angel funding to get venture financing are decreasing.&#8221; As to the cause, Bartoš also points to rapid growth in angel and seed deals &#8212; going so far as to describe it as &#8220;accelerator and angel investing hysteria.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;As far as I am looking at the market, I think the reason is not that the amount of available venture funds is decreasing (well in Europe it never was too high), but that the number of angel and seed deals is rapidly growing. With all the accelerator and angel investing hysteria which we&#8217;re seeing, it is not too surprising that often the quality of the startups with seed funding is low. If that&#8217;s really the case, we should be happy for the Series A crunch as it shows the VCs are keeping their quality standards high – and raising VC is staying as tough as ever which should be the case &#8212; only the best ones should succeed.&#8221;</p><p>So it&#8217;s not that Credo Ventures has reduced the amount of Series A funding it is offering &#8212; it &#8220;still has more than half of the fund available&#8221;, says Bartoš &#8212; but as with the CB Insights report, the problem here is too many seed-funded startups chasing the same pot of funding (and too many &#8220;low quality&#8221; ones at that). &#8220;We like investing into startups with previous seed or angel funding and/or accelerator experience. On the other hand, none of it is a guarantee to get funding, and yet we&#8217;re seeing lots of low-quality startups with previous seed funding,&#8221; he adds.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/runa-capital\">Runa Capital</a> partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andre-bliznyuk/1/26/a47\">Andre Bliznyuk</a> also believes the level of funding on offer at Series A won&#8217;t change. &#8220;We expect that Runa itself will continue to invest in Series A rounds at the same pace as before,&#8221; he says. So the key to unlocking that crucial Series A round is still both as simple and as hard as ever: basically, be an awesome startup. &#8220;We continue to believe that the strongest teams with the best products will continue to be able to raise financing, be it in Russia, Europe or the U.S.,&#8221; he adds. On a side note, Bliznyuk suggests that being an enterprise/B2B startup may increase the odds in your startup&#8217;s favour as that portion of the market has historically been less crowded than the consumer space. &#8220;We have also historically been more focused on enterprise/B2B software companies vs. consumer Internet startups, so our portfolio has largely been unaffected by the overall market exuberance,&#8221; he adds.</p><p>[Image by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/\">BlatantWorld.com</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blatantworld/5054527234/sizes/m/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>]</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/723945/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=g5km-aRS0h8:OqS_V2xQl9Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/g5km-aRS0h8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/from-silicon-valley-to-europe-is-the-u-s-series-a-crunch-affecting-european-startups/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Latin American women generally are not expected or encouraged to enter the hard sciences and engineering — medicine being one of the biggest exceptions.

Women who have begun to appear in the startup scene tend to come from urban higher classes, and their numbers remain low. In addition, the number of women in technical positions (namely, CTOs) is also very low, even though entrepreneurship is currently dominated by educated individuals living in cities. Roughly one out of 15 women found in the startup scene is a coder.

The forum, entitled “Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Forum: Young Women Leadership and Governance, Sharing Experiences Worldwide,” attracted participants from civil and political organizations involved in the fight for equality and gender rights. And although entrepreneurship and technology were part of the agenda, only two participants and a couple of mentors came from the private industry, and just one represented the technology sector.</p><p>During the forum, the gaps between technology and social organizations became very clear. Most participants had very limited knowledge of the current technological resources available to them. Some representatives of indigenous groups were offline altogether. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.women2.com/\">Women 2.0</a> did not attend the event, and few representatives from countries where the organization had recently launched its Founder Friday events (Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile) had heard about them or what they do.</p><p>And some interesting parallels were drawn between female entrepreneurs and activists in Latin America and the Caribbean: both groups strive in the midst of numerous and difficult obstacles and are used to assuming great amounts of responsibility. However, activism is typically an area that many women pursue; entrepreneurship — particularly technological — is not.</p><h6>On A Mission To Slow The Spread Of AIDS</h6><p>Despite the obstacles, examples of women throughout Latin America leading startups and entrepreneurial projects continue to surface. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/maycupcake\">May Alba</a> is a co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rubberit.co/\">Rubberit</a>, a web platform that allows people to buy condoms online through monthly subscriptions. For every condom bought through Rubberit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dktinternational.org/country-programs/mexico/\">DKT International</a> donates another one to someone who can’t afford it. Rubberit just received its first shipment of DKT donations, which means they can return to their hometown of Guanajuato, Mexico, to distribute 5,000 condoms in one of the poorest communities in the area.</p><p>May says her original idea was not to start a web platform, but rather to develop an NGO to distribute condoms for free after seeing a good friend die from AIDS. Rubberit began with a social vision that matched entrepreneurship perfectly, particularly with the problem they’re facing: disrupting a mostly Catholic country where sex is taboo in many areas. May remained focused on solving her physical distribution problem but was running into all kinds of trouble.</p><p>She soon realized that helping people through a startup was easier and made more sense. It became more clear when someone directed her to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/\">Dollar Shave Club</a> where she got the idea to develop Rubberit as an online subscription service. She went in search of a technical co-founder and her brother, who had recently begun to code, offered to help. With some luck, they met their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mexican.vc/\">current investors</a> when a friend emailed them a link to the application page a couple of days before the closing date. They hustled to get a prototype together and went in for the interview. A few weeks later, they got some good news. “I didn’t over think it,” says May. “I just went with what felt right.”</p><p>Their biggest challenge has been distribution, since there is a widespread myth about the Mexican postal service not working. They have proved it does, since most of their distribution has been done through the regular national postal service. Getting the packaging right was no easy task, either. They make every package by hand, so it took seven prototypes to get to one that was sturdy enough, discrete, functional, and doable in under four minutes.</p><p>May says that their long-term goal for Rubberit is to become the main way condoms are bought (“the way you get water or gas — you get condoms and pay for them every month”). She says failure is an option only if they find another, more effective way to get condoms to everyone who needs them. Either way, they are keeping busy fighting big fights: namely teen pregnancy and AIDS.</p><h5>From Buenos Aires To Boston To Santiago</h5><p>Born near Buenos Aires, Argentina, and raised by a doctor and a schoolteacher, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Vanesak\">Vanesa Kolodziej</a> moved to Boston to work during the Argentine economic crisis. While in Boston, she worked briefly at Junior Achievement, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs develop and scale through best practices. Soon after, she started her MBA at Babson College, though never finished her degree. She also managed Fortune 500 accounts as the Hispanic Director at BzzAgent, a venture-backed ad agency. After , she launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bumeran.com.mx/\">Bumeran</a>. During the dot-com era, she led the creation of a crowd-buying company called Comunia. “It was a very intense period where I learned some of the harder lessons in my life as an entrepreneur,” she says.</p><p>Nowadays, after co-founding online tech community <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.palermovalley.com/\">Palermo Valley</a> for Argentina, she’s the managing partner and co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nazcaventures.com/\">Nazca Ventures</a>, an early-stage venture capital fund based in Santiago, Chile. It is the first Latin American “founders collective” fund where the five general and all limited partners are entrepreneurs. They started the firm when they identified a gap in the venture capital ecosystem in Latin America: there were hardly any early-stage investments. They are currently in their final stage of fundraising and will start investing in April 2013.</p><p>Vanesa considers being a woman in the tech industry in South America an advantage. “It helped me attract amazing talent, access key clients and vendors and develop long lasting partnerships.”</p><p>Even though Latin America still has a ways to go to increase the opportunities for women in tech, the region has taken steps in the right direction. A lot has been said about the next great company coming from somewhere outside of the U.S. I’d also put my money on it not being founded by a man.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/722721/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RphBtk1YkCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/RphBtk1YkCg/" (20693 33984) old 6 nil nil ((title nil "In Latin America, Women Are Breaking Barriers To Entrepreneurship") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/RphBtk1YkCg/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/latin-american-women-work-to-break-barrier-to-entry-in-tech/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sat, 22 Dec 2012 10:00:32 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Maria Rocio Paniagua") (category nil "Opinion") (category nil "TC") (category nil "LATAM tech") (category nil "LATAM") (category nil "UN Women") (category nil "United Nations Development Programme") (category nil "United Nations Population Fund") (category nil "Women-2.0") (category nil "Rubberit") (category nil "May Alba") (category nil "Vanesa Kolodziej") (category nil "Nazca Ventures") (guid ((isPermaLink .

However, activism is typically an area that many women pursue; entrepreneurship &#8212; particularly technological &#8212; is not.</p><h6>On A Mission To Slow The Spread Of AIDS</h6><p>Despite the obstacles, examples of women throughout Latin America leading startups and entrepreneurial projects continue to surface. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/maycupcake\">May Alba</a> is a co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rubberit.co/\">Rubberit</a>, a web platform that allows people to buy condoms online through monthly subscriptions. For every condom bought through Rubberit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dktinternational.org/country-programs/mexico/\">DKT International</a> donates another one to someone who can’t afford it. Rubberit just received its first shipment of DKT donations, which means they can return to their hometown of Guanajuato, Mexico, to distribute 5,000 condoms in one of the poorest communities in the area.</p><p>May says her original idea was not to start a web platform, but rather to develop an NGO to distribute condoms for free after seeing a good friend die from AIDS. Rubberit began with a social vision that matched entrepreneurship perfectly, particularly with the problem they’re facing: disrupting a mostly Catholic country where sex is taboo in many areas. May remained focused on solving her physical distribution problem but was running into all kinds of trouble.</p><p>She soon realized that helping people through a startup was easier and made more sense. It became more clear when someone directed her to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/\">Dollar Shave Club</a> where she got the idea to develop Rubberit as an online subscription service. She went in search of a technical co-founder and her brother, who had recently begun to code, offered to help. With some luck, they met their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mexican.vc/\">current investors</a> when a friend emailed them a link to the application page a couple of days before the closing date. They hustled to get a prototype together and went in for the interview. A few weeks later, they got some good news. “I didn’t over think it,” says May. “I just went with what felt right.”</p><p>Their biggest challenge has been distribution, since there is a widespread myth about the Mexican postal service not working. They have proved it does, since most of their distribution has been done through the regular national postal service. Getting the packaging right was no easy task, either. They make every package by hand, so it took seven prototypes to get to one that was sturdy enough, discrete, functional, and doable in under four minutes.</p><p>May says that their long-term goal for Rubberit is to become the main way condoms are bought (“the way you get water or gas &#8212; you get condoms and pay for them every month”). She says failure is an option only if they find another, more effective way to get condoms to everyone who needs them. Either way, they are keeping busy fighting big fights: namely teen pregnancy and AIDS.</p><h5>From Buenos Aires To Boston To Santiago</h5><p>Born near Buenos Aires, Argentina, and raised by a doctor and a schoolteacher, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Vanesak\">Vanesa Kolodziej</a> moved to Boston to work during the Argentine economic crisis. While in Boston, she worked briefly at Junior Achievement, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs develop and scale through best practices. Soon after, she started her MBA at Babson College, though never finished her degree. She also managed Fortune 500 accounts as the Hispanic Director at BzzAgent, a venture-backed ad agency. After , she launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bumeran.com.mx/\">Bumeran</a>. During the dot-com era, she led the creation of a crowd-buying company called Comunia. “It was a very intense period where I learned some of the harder lessons in my life as an entrepreneur,” she says.</p><p>Nowadays, after co-founding online tech community <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.palermovalley.com/\">Palermo Valley</a> for Argentina, she’s the managing partner and co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nazcaventures.com/\">Nazca Ventures</a>, an early-stage venture capital fund based in Santiago, Chile. It is the first Latin American &#8220;founders collective&#8221; fund where the five general and all limited partners are entrepreneurs. They started the firm when they identified a gap in the venture capital ecosystem in Latin America: there were hardly any early-stage investments. They are currently in their final stage of fundraising and will start investing in April 2013.</p><p>Vanesa considers being a woman in the tech industry in South America an advantage. &#8220;It helped me attract amazing talent, access key clients and vendors and develop long lasting partnerships.&#8221;</p><p>Even though Latin America still has a ways to go to increase the opportunities for women in tech, the region has taken steps in the right direction. A lot has been said about the next great company coming from somewhere outside of the U.S. I’d also put my money on it not being founded by a man.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/722721/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RphBtk1YkCg:8el_LJzWGF8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RphBtk1YkCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/latin-american-women-work-to-break-barrier-to-entry-in-tech/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Boogers*</a>, we didn’t believe it.</p><p>That’s not the TechCrunch app, we said. It has to be a clone. The logo is different, we said. Our COO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ned-desmond\">Ned Desmond</a> even downloaded a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tapjoy.com/\">Tapjoy</a> game and started playing it, just to prove it wasn’t the real TechCrunch app being offered up for fewer Premium Play credits than Bubble Safari.</p><p>“It’s not TechCrunch’s practice to pay for downloads or any traffic,” our Director of Product <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ccying\">Christine Ying</a> insisted when I asked her if she knew why our legit mobile app was hanging out with the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/big-win-slots/id468559262?mt=8\">Big Win Slots</a> in all of its desperate splendor in the middle of Draw Something Free! (or insert other lame mobile game here).</p><p>Finally, our COO got to Level 5 of Goobers Vs. Boogers or whatever, and we discovered that it was indeed the TechCrunch app being pushed upon innocent social mobile gamers, all with the eventual goal of pushing these terrible terrible apps to the App Store Top Charts. This is sad.</p><p>Because, despite our impassioned doubts, we <em>were</em> actually complicit in this without our consent. As far as we can tell, Aol has some sort of deal with Tapjoy for its other apps (I dunno, MovieFone) and TechCrunch was rolled into it. Neither <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-eldon\">Eric Eldon</a> or I or anyone else at TechCrunch were consulted about or aware of this decision, which is <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">not without precedent</a>. This pisses me off. Eldon is on vacation, but I’m pretty sure it would piss him off, too.</p><p>Because straight up paying for downloads, or traffic, to a blog is insidious and it makes users and readers wrinkle their noses when they read the phrase “paying for downloads.” And we are good enough that we don’t need to do it.</p><p>Despite, or even because of, the trolls, people love TechCrunch. If they’re not downloading our app, it’s probably because it crashes. I’ve read the reviews. As Christine pointed out earlier, TechCrunch has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">traditionally been against paying for traffic </a>(or downloads) of editorial content, because our content is actually interesting, and paid traffic tends to be very low quality. It’s our fault if the vehicle of that content is flawed to the point where people don’t want to use it, and paying people to do so doesn’t solve the problem.</p><p>So, since Michael raised a stink about it earlier, our <del>occupying</del> parent company is trying to pull us from whatever this deal is — to its credit. But, just TechCrunch as far as we know.</p><p>This is also sad. Why not pull all the Aol properties from Tapjoy, whatever they are? Why just one? Tapjoy is spammy and scuzzy and exists to game Apple’s top App Store rankings for apps that are probably not worth downloading. Otherwise, why would those apps be paying people to? In fact, Apple itself <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/11/apple-stomps-on-tapjoys-app-download-circle-jerk-again/\">has cracked down</a> on Tapjoy since it became aware of its practices. If they (Aol) pull a deal in one case (us) because of this principle, they should pull in all of them. Why make an exception?</p><p>Since we’ve investigated this, we’ve also been made aware that Aol pays for Google Ads on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/events/crunchies-2012/event-info-2/\">The Crunchies</a>, but that sort of sits better with me, at least, because that event is very clearly defined as a revenue opportunity.

Boogers*</a>, we didn&#8217;t believe it.</p><p>That&#8217;s not the TechCrunch app, we said. It has to be a clone. The logo is different, we said. Our COO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ned-desmond\">Ned Desmond</a> even downloaded a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tapjoy.com/\">Tapjoy</a> game and started playing it, just to prove it wasn&#8217;t the real TechCrunch app being offered up for fewer Premium Play credits than Bubble Safari.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not TechCrunch&#8217;s practice to pay for downloads or any traffic,&#8221; our Director of Product <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ccying\">Christine Ying</a> insisted when I asked her if she knew why our legit mobile app was hanging out with the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/big-win-slots/id468559262?mt=8\">Big Win Slots</a> in all of its desperate splendor in the middle of Draw Something Free! (or insert other lame mobile game here).</p><p>Finally, our COO got to Level 5 of Goobers Vs. Boogers or whatever, and we discovered that it was indeed the TechCrunch app being pushed upon innocent social mobile gamers, all with the eventual goal of pushing these terrible terrible apps to the App Store Top Charts. This is sad.</p><p>Because, despite our impassioned doubts, we <em>were</em> actually complicit in this without our consent. As far as we can tell, Aol has some sort of deal with Tapjoy for its other apps (I dunno, MovieFone) and TechCrunch was rolled into it. Neither <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-eldon\">Eric Eldon</a> or I or anyone else at TechCrunch were consulted about or aware of this decision, which is <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">not without precedent</a>. This pisses me off. Eldon is on vacation, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it would piss him off, too.</p><p>Because straight up paying for downloads, or traffic, to a blog is insidious and it makes users and readers wrinkle their noses when they read the phrase &#8220;paying for downloads.&#8221; And we are good enough that we don&#8217;t need to do it.</p><p>Despite, or even because of, the trolls, people love TechCrunch. If they&#8217;re not downloading our app, it&#8217;s probably because it crashes. I&#8217;ve read the reviews. As Christine pointed out earlier, TechCrunch has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/real-blogs-dont-buy-ads-on-google/\">traditionally been against paying for traffic </a>(or downloads) of editorial content, because our content is actually interesting, and paid traffic tends to be very low quality. It&#8217;s our fault if the vehicle of that content is flawed to the point where people don&#8217;t want to use it, and paying people to do so doesn&#8217;t solve the problem.</p><p>So, since Michael raised a stink about it earlier, our <del>occupying</del> parent company is trying to pull us from whatever this deal is &#8212; to its credit. But, just TechCrunch as far as we know.</p><p>This is also sad. Why not pull all the Aol properties from Tapjoy, whatever they are? Why just one? Tapjoy is spammy and scuzzy and exists to game Apple&#8217;s top App Store rankings for apps that are probably not worth downloading. Otherwise, why would those apps be paying people to? In fact, Apple itself <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/11/apple-stomps-on-tapjoys-app-download-circle-jerk-again/\">has cracked down</a> on Tapjoy since it became aware of its practices. If they (Aol) pull a deal in one case (us) because of this principle, they should pull in all of them. Why make an exception?</p><p>Since we&#8217;ve investigated this, we&#8217;ve also been made aware that Aol pays for Google Ads on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/events/crunchies-2012/event-info-2/\">The Crunchies</a>, but that sort of sits better with me, at least, because that event is very clearly defined as a revenue opportunity. People can buy tickets through those links, and the ads aren&#8217;t being used to artificially puff up our traffic numbers.</p><p>Aol and/or our business side may think it&#8217;s smart to extend these sorts of lame practices over to editorial content without telling us or asking for our input, but we don&#8217;t. And until they stop, we&#8217;re going to make fun of them, just like we would have in junior high. With all due respect, of course.</p><p><em>*<strong>Note:</strong> Goobers Vs.

Think about that. What’s more critical than having your own freedom? So last year we provided over $11 million in grants to address the issue of human trafficking and slavery. Our support helped to free thousands of people and is keeping millions more from ever falling victim to this horrible crime. We’re seeing a lot more attention to this issue from governments, nonprofits and the media. And that type of awareness is key to fighting a problem like slavery.</p><p><strong>What are your long-term goals as a company to keep trying to help push the world “forward” for good?</strong></p><p>From the very beginning, Larry and Sergey have talked about using technology and innovation to drive ambitious social impact. That’s pretty unconventional for a company, and we hold ourselves to a high standard for how we can do that. Google engineers develop products such as Public Alerts through Crisis Response or Flu Trends. We have programs for free and discounted ads and apps for nonprofits. My team’s goal is to encourage innovation in the social impact sector.</p><p><strong>Can you share an anecdote about how something Google has done has affected or benefited someone directly?</strong></p><p>One of our grantees, Samasource, is working in Africa, South Asia and other marginalized areas to bring paid work to people in need. Last year with our support they helped over 2,000 people escape poverty through computer-based microwork. One young woman in Kenya started out in the Samasource center and moved on to start an NGO to stop gender-based violence in universities. She used the income generated from her Samasource assignments to start that organization.</p><p><strong>How long has Google done this?</strong></p><p>Giving back and supporting innovation has been a core part of Google’s culture since the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Do you have plans for any hackathons with a focus on helping people?</strong></p><p>We’ve done a few ‘develop for good’ hackathons in the past, and have received submissions for how to tackle issues in sustainability, illicit networks and citizen engagement. We’ve found that engineers are really eager to put their tech skills to good use and have important insights to offer nonprofits for how they can be more data-oriented. We’re looking to do more hackathons in the future, so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>What’s the most difficult part of trying to do things “for good”? Do you get a lot of presentations and pleas for help sent your way?</strong></p><p>We don’t accept unsolicited proposals for the Global Impact Awards, but our team works through hundreds of ideas sourced from Googlers. We also do proactive analyses of various issues and potential solutions. For me, I think the biggest challenge is that no amount of money can be thrown at these types of problems to make them go away in a night. There’s always a need for incremental aid that will pull at the heart strings and that’s hard. But while it may not be as sexy, we think funding tech and innovation is the best way for Google to help drive transformational impact at scale.</p><p>———</p><p>It’s extremely important that large companies like Google are participating in nonprofit activities that benefit the greater good of the world. Facebook has done this on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=8925133\">multiple occasions</a>, with its CEO <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/24/techcrunch-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-on-100-million-education-donation/\">Mark Zuckerberg leading the way</a>.</p><p>All tech companies can participate, even individual developers, marketers and executives.

We launched Global Impact Awards to help spur innovation and contribute to the movement toward more data-driven philanthropy.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/2QFPSY9JgNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p><strong>What are some of the things you&#8217;ve done in the past to help bring awareness to important needs and events?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/the-weekly-good-googles-director-of-giving-discusses-global-concerns-and-action/0c8f52a/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725458\"></a>We were shocked to learn that more people are enslaved today than at any other point in human history. Think about that. What&#8217;s more critical than having your own freedom? So last year we provided over $11 million in grants to address the issue of human trafficking and slavery. Our support helped to free thousands of people and is keeping millions more from ever falling victim to this horrible crime. We&#8217;re seeing a lot more attention to this issue from governments, nonprofits and the media. And that type of awareness is key to fighting a problem like slavery.</p><p><strong>What are your long-term goals as a company to keep trying to help push the world &#8220;forward&#8221; for good?</strong></p><p>From the very beginning, Larry and Sergey have talked about using technology and innovation to drive ambitious social impact. That&#8217;s pretty unconventional for a company, and we hold ourselves to a high standard for how we can do that. Google engineers develop products such as Public Alerts through Crisis Response or Flu Trends. We have programs for free and discounted ads and apps for nonprofits. My team&#8217;s goal is to encourage innovation in the social impact sector.</p><p><strong>Can you share an anecdote about how something Google has done has affected or benefited someone directly?</strong></p><p>One of our grantees, Samasource, is working in Africa, South Asia and other marginalized areas to bring paid work to people in need. Last year with our support they helped over 2,000 people escape poverty through computer-based microwork. One young woman in Kenya started out in the Samasource center and moved on to start an NGO to stop gender-based violence in universities. She used the income generated from her Samasource assignments to start that organization.</p><p><strong>How long has Google done this?</strong></p><p>Giving back and supporting innovation has been a core part of Google&#8217;s culture since the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Do you have plans for any hackathons with a focus on helping people?</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve done a few &#8216;develop for good&#8217; hackathons in the past, and have received submissions for how to tackle issues in sustainability, illicit networks and citizen engagement. We&#8217;ve found that engineers are really eager to put their tech skills to good use and have important insights to offer nonprofits for how they can be more data-oriented. We&#8217;re looking to do more hackathons in the future, so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s the most difficult part of trying to do things &#8220;for good&#8221;? Do you get a lot of presentations and pleas for help sent your way?</strong></p><p>We don&#8217;t accept unsolicited proposals for the Global Impact Awards, but our team works through hundreds of ideas sourced from Googlers. We also do proactive analyses of various issues and potential solutions. For me, I think the biggest challenge is that no amount of money can be thrown at these types of problems to make them go away in a night. There&#8217;s always a need for incremental aid that will pull at the heart strings and that&#8217;s hard. But while it may not be as sexy, we think funding tech and innovation is the best way for Google to help drive transformational impact at scale.</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><p>It&#8217;s extremely important that large companies like Google are participating in nonprofit activities that benefit the greater good of the world. Facebook has done this on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=8925133\">multiple occasions</a>, with its CEO <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/24/techcrunch-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-on-100-million-education-donation/\">Mark Zuckerberg leading the way</a>.</p><p>All tech companies can participate, even individual developers, marketers and executives.

The new money will allow Steamboat — and by extension, Disney — to continue making investments in digital media, as the market continues to heat up.</p><p>Like other investment portfolios linked to major media conglomerates, Steamboat tends to makes strategic investments in startups that focus on digital video, gaming, and advertising — basically all things that could facilitate Disney’s embrace of digital media. Example companies in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://steamboatvc.com/portfolio.php?country=us&amp;language=en&amp;list=list\">its portfolio</a> include content-delivery network Edgecast Networks, encoding technology provider Elemental Technologies, online ad startup FreeWheel, and portable camera maker GoPro, all of which seem to be doing fairly well.</p><p>The firm has had its share of successes, such as Playdom, which was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/playdom-acquired-by-disney-for-up-to-763-2-million/\">bought by Disney</a> for more than $750 million in 2010, as well as Pure Digital (acquired by Cisco) and GreyStripe (bought by ValueClick).

It came back better than ever, Jawbone said, and for the most part that seems to be true. Flaky syncing used to mar my original, even though I never experienced the same cataclysmic failure as others. This time around, I noticed a problem initially that others in the office have also seen, and a few other users are already reporting: a matte finish on the end cap that’s prone to peeling. It looks cheap.</p><p>Two of our staff units are exhibiting this already, both after just a few days’ use. And we’ve also found a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/unravel101/status/279809494039535617\">report on Twitter</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/TROUBLESHOOTING/Coating-peeling-off/m-p/48794\">someone else complaining of the same thing</a> on Jawbone’s official forums. Two suggested fixes from that thread: don’t ever remove your Jawbone UP (lol), and buy the three-pack replacement caps that Jawbone offers in its official store. Both are obviously less than ideal. An ideal solution would be this not happening to begin with.</p><p>The cap complaints are echoed by a number of people in the Jawbone forums on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/WELCOME/Cap-issues-with-new-Jawbone-Up/m-p/48282\">other threads</a>, and also include users complaining of caps that come loose during vigorous activity. This was an issue with the original version, and one reportedly made better with version two. Jawbone says your first replacement cap is free, but after that, you have to go through the store and purchase new ones. Presumably, that won’t make them any more resistant to this flaking issue, too.</p><p>These Jawbone UP’s may not be dying permanently at random, and sure, the issue is mostly cosmetic, but the Up is $130: at that price, you’re not expecting it to start showing wear from normal use 48 hours after you crack the packaging. We’ve reached out to Jawbone looking for an explanation, but in the meantime let us know if you’re seeing this issue, or any other problems with your UP wristband.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/jawbone-band-bad.jpg\"></a></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725235/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/n0jbQ-S4ayU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/n0jbQ-S4ayU/" (20692 57700) old 15 nil nil ((title nil "Jawbone UP Users: How Is Your End Cap Holding Up?")

It came back better than ever, Jawbone said, and for the most part that seems to be true. Flaky syncing used to mar my original, even though I never experienced the same cataclysmic failure as others. This time around, I noticed a problem initially that others in the office have also seen, and a few other users are already reporting: a matte finish on the end cap that&#8217;s prone to peeling. It looks cheap.</p><p>Two of our staff units are exhibiting this already, both after just a few days&#8217; use. And we&#8217;ve also found a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/unravel101/status/279809494039535617\">report on Twitter</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/TROUBLESHOOTING/Coating-peeling-off/m-p/48794\">someone else complaining of the same thing</a> on Jawbone&#8217;s official forums. Two suggested fixes from that thread: don&#8217;t ever remove your Jawbone UP (lol), and buy the three-pack replacement caps that Jawbone offers in its official store. Both are obviously less than ideal. An ideal solution would be this not happening to begin with.</p><p>The cap complaints are echoed by a number of people in the Jawbone forums on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/WELCOME/Cap-issues-with-new-Jawbone-Up/m-p/48282\">other threads</a>, and also include users complaining of caps that come loose during vigorous activity. This was an issue with the original version, and one reportedly made better with version two. Jawbone says your first replacement cap is free, but after that, you have to go through the store and purchase new ones. Presumably, that won&#8217;t make them any more resistant to this flaking issue, too.</p><p>These Jawbone UP&#8217;s may not be dying permanently at random, and sure, the issue is mostly cosmetic, but the Up is $130: at that price, you&#8217;re not expecting it to start showing wear from normal use 48 hours after you crack the packaging. We&#8217;ve reached out to Jawbone looking for an explanation, but in the meantime let us know if you&#8217;re seeing this issue, or any other problems with your UP wristband.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/jawbone-band-bad.jpg\"></a></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725235/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=n0jbQ-S4ayU:uMbj2hufVqM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/n0jbQ-S4ayU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/jawbone-up-users-how-is-your-end-cap-holding-up/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

The API, which was announced at Google I/O in June, could pave the way for more interesting video-related apps that leverage YouTube videos.</p><p>With the launch of the new Android API, developers will now be able to embed high-quality videos to their apps without having to leverage YouTube’s WebView implementation. For apps on Android, that means no more iframes. It also means that developers will have a much richer suite of available actions and features that they’ll be able to take advantage of.</p><p>Available for apps on Froyo devices or later, the API provides access to full-screen video and orientation change support, as well as closed-caption display, support for YouTube ads, and direct access to the Android YouTube app. While being launched on an experimental basis, the API will drastically improve the experience for users tuning in to videos on Android apps.</p><p>Earlier today, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/9x9-tv/\">I bemoaned the lack of Android apps</a> which support video discovery and native YouTube embeds while writing about 9×9.tv. Indeed, that app is one of the first to take advantage of the new API, providing a new form of video discovery for Android users. Soundtracking — which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/soundtracking-for-android/\">Josh wrote about yesterday</a> — is also leveraging the new API to provide some new, Android-only features.

Groupon Goods is a bit of a soup-to-nuts effort: it’s a platform for different merchants to post sales of diamond jewellery and designer sunglasses, but also mattresses, computers and cutlery.

You could see something like CommerceInterface sitting as part of a wider service portfolio that Groupon offers to merchants as a “one-stop shop” for all their e-e-commerce needs.

CHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Groupon (<a href=\"http://www.groupon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.groupon.com</a>) (NASDAQ: GRPN) announced today it has acquired CommerceInterface (<a href=\"http://www.commerceinterface.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.commerceinterface.com</a>), a leading provider of web-based channel management technology that helps manufacturers, distributors and retailers succeed at managing their businesses and selling online. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>Groupon has used CommerceInterface technology since April 2012 to streamline operations of the growing Groupon Goods platform and automate interactions with thousands of existing vendors. The acquisition enables Groupon to leverage infrastructure provided by CommerceInterface to support and optimize the Groupon Goods business around the world in 2013.</p><p>“CommerceInterface has proven to be an important piece of Groupon Goods infrastructure in the U.S., quickly and reliably streamlining the execution of orders and other vendor interactions,” said Faisal Masud, head of Groupon Goods. “We look forward to enhancing our abilities to better support merchants overseas beginning early next year.”</p><p>CommerceInterface will no longer service other retail channels and current customers will have the option to transition to other vendors over the next six months with migration support from the company.</p><p>In Q3 2012, Groupon Goods reached an annual run rate of nearly $1.5 billion in global billings.

Today, it put another link into the second of these strategies with the acquisition of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.commerceinterface.com/\">CommerceInterface</a>, a channel management technology used in e-commerce operations that aggregate goods from multiple vendors.</p><p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed. And it doesn&#8217;t look like CommerceInterface, headquartered in Salt Lake City and operational since 2007, had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/commerceinterface\">raised any significant funds</a> from outside investors previously.</p><p>Groupon had already been using CommerceInterface in its own Groupon Goods operations since April of this year, it said in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://investor.groupon.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=728531\">release</a>. Groupon Goods is a bit of a soup-to-nuts effort: it&#8217;s a platform for different merchants to post sales of diamond jewellery and designer sunglasses, but also mattresses, computers and cutlery. So this could be a matter of the company wanting to better integrate the service as it continues to build up that business, which as of Q3 was on a run rate of $1.5 billion in global billings. Using an outsourced service could be less efficient in that case.</p><p>&#8220;CommerceInterface has proven to be an important piece of Groupon Goods infrastructure in the U.S., quickly and reliably streamlining the execution of orders and other vendor interactions,&#8221; said Faisal Masud, head of Groupon Goods, in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to enhancing our abilities to better support merchants overseas beginning early next year.&#8221;</p><p>When I first heard about this deal, I thought it could be a good way for Groupon to add yet another service to its portfolio that it can offer on to other businesses to improve their overall e-commerce operations.</p><p>CommerceInterface currently offers a platform to merchants to help them optimise how and where they list their items to sell across different marketplaces &#8212; be they eBay, Amazon, Fab, Groupon Goods, or somewhere else. You could see something like CommerceInterface sitting as part of a wider service portfolio that Groupon offers to merchants as a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for all their e-e-commerce needs. Groupon has made a number of other acquisitions that you could put into the category of B2B IT services, including its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/groupon-picks-up-breadcrumb-for-a-little-pos-magic/\">Breadcrumb point-of-sale buy earlier this year</a>. That app got an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/breadcrumb-app-expedites-operations-restaurant-183500972.html\">update</a> just earlier today.</p><p>But according to the release, this doesn&#8217;t look like it will be the case: &#8220;CommerceInterface will no longer service other retail channels and current customers will have the option to transition to other vendors over the next six months with migration support from the company,&#8221; the company says. That&#8217;s a missed opportunity, I think.</p><p>Full release below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Groupon Acquires Channel Management Provider CommerceInterface<br /></strong><br />
CHICAGO&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211; Groupon (<a href=\"http://www.groupon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.groupon.com</a>) (NASDAQ: GRPN) announced today it has acquired CommerceInterface (<a href=\"http://www.commerceinterface.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.commerceinterface.com</a>), a leading provider of web-based channel management technology that helps manufacturers, distributors and retailers succeed at managing their businesses and selling online. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>Groupon has used CommerceInterface technology since April 2012 to streamline operations of the growing Groupon Goods platform and automate interactions with thousands of existing vendors. The acquisition enables Groupon to leverage infrastructure provided by CommerceInterface to support and optimize the Groupon Goods business around the world in 2013.</p><p>&#8220;CommerceInterface has proven to be an important piece of Groupon Goods infrastructure in the U.S., quickly and reliably streamlining the execution of orders and other vendor interactions,&#8221; said Faisal Masud, head of Groupon Goods. &#8220;We look forward to enhancing our abilities to better support merchants overseas beginning early next year.&#8221;</p><p>CommerceInterface will no longer service other retail channels and current customers will have the option to transition to other vendors over the next six months with migration support from the company.</p><p>In Q3 2012, Groupon Goods reached an annual run rate of nearly $1.5 billion in global billings. A wide variety of high quality inventory is featured, from diamond jewelry and designer sunglasses to mattresses, computer tablets, 3D HD televisions and the giant radio-controlled flying shark.

Poke is a big move into the ephemeral messaging space for Facebook, and it could give it even more data on who your closest friends are.</p><p>Facebook was convinced it needed an expiring messages app. Snapchat’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&amp;hl=en\">Android apps</a> were gaining serious traction with young users. Over 50 million photos are getting shared on Snapchat each day for a total of 1 billion traded on the service compared to Facebook’s 300 million photos shared a day. Clearly there was something magical about self-destructing media.</p><p>Seems that Facebook didn’t want to wait for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a> to get so big it’d have to make another costly acquisition like Instagram and instead decided to compete early. We heard rumors that it had made overtures about acquiring Snapchat, but when the founders decided to stay independent, Facebook built its own version in just 12 days. Why would Facebook’s Blake Ross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">share</a> that fact? Beacause it’s that kind of tenacity and lack of red tape that attracts great talent to come work at Facebook. It’s also a signal to startups about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/38501585852/12-days\">just how fast Facebook can steamroll them</a>.</p><h4>How Do You Poke?</h4><p>The Poke app brings the classic contentless message into the mobile media-sharing age, but it’s actually a completely separate feature. Facebook explains that the app is designed to let you contact friends from wherever you are and show them what you’re doing. Here’s how the announcement describes how the app works:</p><blockquote><p><em>“With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you’re up to in a lightweight way. You can poke an individual friend or several at once. Each message expires after a specific time you’ve set, either 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When time runs out, the message disappears from the app. “</em></p></blockquote><p>Essentially you pick a type of message to send — either a poke, text, photo, or video — and choose a friend or multiple friends to send it to. You can then set the expiration timer, add a location, overlay text or draw on a photo, and then send it. Recipients get a push notification with a little voice saying “Poke!”, open the Poke app, see your name and what type of message you sent, and then hold down on the message thread to view the content until the timer runs out and the message disappears.</p><p>The app is all mobile and completely separate from Facebook’s other apps and desktop site. If you Poke someone on Facebook.com by going to their profile, they won’t get that Poke in the App, and nothing you do in the app can be seen outside of it. There’s currently no way to view Poke app messages on the web.</p><p>For now the Poke app is iOS only, but you can expect a release for Android soon as Snapchat is already there. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">Poke was built in under two weeks</a> by a small team led Facebook’s veteran Director of Product Blake Ross, so there’s probably a lot of development still left to get it where Facebook wants it to be. There’s a chance that self-destructing media could make its way into Facebook’s main app, as the company has said that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/09/standalone-guinea-pigs/\">power users of its standalone apps like Camera and Messenger are guinea pigs</a> for features it’s considering for the flagship apps.</p><p>As for privacy, Poke simply links back to the main Facebook terms of service, which would imply Facebook can save all the content from the app until you delete your account. However, a Facebook spokesperson tells me “All Poke messages are retained for two days after being read, to help facilitate abuse reporting.” This implies photos are deleted after that. The statement references the fact that users can flag messages as inappropriate if they’re getting nude or otherwise alarming Pokes. Facebook also gives paranoid Pokers have the option to clear their inbox so any unread messages are instantly destroyed.</p><h4>A Poke To The Gut For Snapchat</h4><p>Poke is pretty unabashed clone of Snapchat. Both apps let you draw and overlay text on photos before you send the little timebombs. They also notify the person you’re chatting with if you take a screenshot of what they sent you. For a quick reference, check out this <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-vs-snapchat-what-is-the-difference/\">chart comparing the features of the two apps</a>.</p><p>Poke adds some useful extras. It offers simple text messages, in addition to video and photos. You can add a location to where you record a Poke message. Also, in Poke you can have group conversations, whereas on Snapchat you can message multiple people at once but not keep them all in a thread.</p><p>One thing Poke does lack is the ability to message people in your phone book, not just Facebook friends. In terms of design, Poke’s biggest flaw right now is a slight delay from when you hold on a message to when the content appears and the timer starts ticking. This caused me to lift my finger to try tapping again, canceling the previous view. Snapchat’s quickness is highly revered by its users, and Facebook will have make Poke more responsive, but otherwise the app feels well crafted.</p><p>Poke is a big problem for Snapchat, which is unfortunate for the small, scrappy team out of Stanford. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">GigaOm reported</a> Snapchat is in the middle of closing a big round of funding led by Benchmark Capital, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">our sources</a> indicate it’s raising over $10 million at a $70 million valuation. That value might fluctuate with Poke’s release. It certainly validates the space, but only by bringing an 800-pound blue gorilla into it. It seems Snapchat CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel see this as confirming his company is working on something important, as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/snapchat-co-founder-evan-spiegel-responds-to-poke-welcome-facebook-seriously/\">his response to the launch of Poke was “Welcome, Facebook. Seriously.”</a></p><p>Poke has some big advantages it will bring to the fight with Snapchat, most specifically in distribution. Facebook does some nifty things to onboard people. If someone else uses the Poke app to send you a message, but you haven’t installed Poke yet, you’ll get a push notification from you main Facebook app asking you to download Poke. Facebook also routinely cross-promotes its standalone apps with banners at the top of its primary apps. For example, a download button for Poke at the top of Facebook for iOS which has around 125 million users could drive tons of installs.</p><p>The question now is whether users will be comfortable sharing on Poke. Snapchat’s outsider status gave it some street cred, especially amongst teenagers who view Facebook as a tool of the generation before them. After Facebook’s privacy troubles over the years, some people don’t fully trust it.</p><p>If Snapchat actually was mainly a sexting app, it’d probably be fine despite Poke because people would be scared to intermingle racy photos with their widely accessible Facebook presence.. But it’s not all about sexting. Snapchat is mostly for sharing goofy photos that months or years later might seem inane but at the time are hilarious. Using Poke for a few minutes I already get the feeling it can handle this silly and addicting use case well. I’ve already gotten a few laughs out of it.</p><p>Poke could successfully slow the growth of Snapchat and deter others from entering the space, which would keep more sharing in the Facebook ecosystem. Inevitably the question is how Facebook will make money on Poke. Right now there’s no ads. One day there might be, but its launch seems more focused on creating something fun for users while boxing out a potential disruptor. Mark Zuckerberg pulled the rug out from under Myspace, and he doesn’t want anyone doing the same to him.</p><p>Even if it doesn’t earn money directly, Poke is very important to Facebook. The people you send ephemeral messages to are often your closest friends. Facebook needs to know this intimate social graph to be able to tune its news feed and other parts of the service to show you the most relevant content. Because really, if you send someone a photo of you with a purple mustaches drawn on top, you probably want to see what they’re sharing with everyone else.</p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/#gallery-725205-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a><p><em>You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id588594730\">download Poke from the App Store here</a>. </em></p><p><em>And there’s a cute little Easter Egg in it. If you drag your messages list all the way up, you’ll see the text “I’ll find something to put here”. This is the same text Mark Zuckerberg left in the bottom of the Facebook.com footer in the early days of the site.</em></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725205/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ao20iia0sWE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/ao20iia0sWE/" (20692 49788) obsolete 19 nil nil ((title nil "Facebook Launches Snapchat Competitor “Poke”, An iOS App For Sending Expiring Text, Photos, And Videos") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/ao20iia0sWE/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 20:11:40 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Josh Constine") (category nil "Apps") (category nil "Mobile") (category nil "Social") (category nil "TC") (category nil "facebook") (category nil "Facebook Poke") (category nil "facebook mobile") (category nil "snapchat") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Recipients get a push notification with a little voice saying &#8220;Poke!&#8221;, open the Poke app, see your name and what type of message you sent, and then hold down on the message thread to view the content until the timer runs out and the message disappears.</p><p>The app is all mobile and completely separate from Facebook&#8217;s other apps and desktop site. If you Poke someone on Facebook.com by going to their profile, they won&#8217;t get that Poke in the App, and nothing you do in the app can be seen outside of it. There&#8217;s currently no way to view Poke app messages on the web.</p><p>For now the Poke app is iOS only, but you can expect a release for Android soon as Snapchat is already there. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/448334501889024\">Poke was built in under two weeks</a> by a small team led Facebook&#8217;s veteran Director of Product Blake Ross, so there&#8217;s probably a lot of development still left to get it where Facebook wants it to be. There&#8217;s a chance that self-destructing media could make its way into Facebook&#8217;s main app, as the company has said that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/09/standalone-guinea-pigs/\">power users of its standalone apps like Camera and Messenger are guinea pigs</a> for features it&#8217;s considering for the flagship apps.</p><p>As for privacy, Poke simply links back to the main Facebook terms of service, which would imply Facebook can save all the content from the app until you delete your account. However, a Facebook spokesperson tells me &#8220;All Poke messages are retained for two days after being read, to help facilitate abuse reporting.&#8221; This implies photos are deleted after that. The statement references the fact that users can flag messages as inappropriate if they&#8217;re getting nude or otherwise alarming Pokes. Facebook also gives paranoid Pokers have the option to clear their inbox so any unread messages are instantly destroyed.</p><h4>A Poke To The Gut For Snapchat</h4><p>Poke is pretty unabashed clone of Snapchat. Both apps let you draw and overlay text on photos before you send the little timebombs. They also notify the person you&#8217;re chatting with if you take a screenshot of what they sent you. For a quick reference, check out this <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-vs-snapchat-what-is-the-difference/\">chart comparing the features of the two apps</a>.</p><p>Poke adds some useful extras. It offers simple text messages, in addition to video and photos. You can add a location to where you record a Poke message. Also, in Poke you can have group conversations, whereas on Snapchat you can message multiple people at once but not keep them all in a thread.</p><p>One thing Poke does lack is the ability to message people in your phone book, not just Facebook friends. In terms of design, Poke&#8217;s biggest flaw right now is a slight delay from when you hold on a message to when the content appears and the timer starts ticking. This caused me to lift my finger to try tapping again, canceling the previous view. Snapchat&#8217;s quickness is highly revered by its users, and Facebook will have make Poke more responsive, but otherwise the app feels well crafted.</p><p>Poke is a big problem for Snapchat, which is unfortunate for the small, scrappy team out of Stanford. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">GigaOm reported</a> Snapchat is in the middle of closing a big round of funding led by Benchmark Capital, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/sources-snapchat-raising-north-of-10m-at-around-70m-valuation-led-by-benchmarks-mitch-lasky/\">our sources</a> indicate it&#8217;s raising over $10 million at a $70 million valuation. That value might fluctuate with Poke&#8217;s release. It certainly validates the space, but only by bringing an 800-pound blue gorilla into it. It seems Snapchat CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel see this as confirming his company is working on something important, as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/snapchat-co-founder-evan-spiegel-responds-to-poke-welcome-facebook-seriously/\">his response to the launch of Poke was &#8220;Welcome, Facebook. Seriously.&#8221;</a></p><p>Poke has some big advantages it will bring to the fight with Snapchat, most specifically in distribution. Facebook does some nifty things to onboard people. If someone else uses the Poke app to send you a message, but you haven&#8217;t installed Poke yet, you&#8217;ll get a push notification from you main Facebook app asking you to download Poke. Facebook also routinely cross-promotes its standalone apps with banners at the top of its primary apps. For example, a download button for Poke at the top of Facebook for iOS which has around 125 million users could drive tons of installs.</p><p>The question now is whether users will be comfortable sharing on Poke. Snapchat&#8217;s outsider status gave it some street cred, especially amongst teenagers who view Facebook as a tool of the generation before them. After Facebook&#8217;s privacy troubles over the years, some people don&#8217;t fully trust it.</p><p>If Snapchat actually was mainly a sexting app, it&#8217;d probably be fine despite Poke because people would be scared to intermingle racy photos with their widely accessible Facebook presence.. But it&#8217;s not all about sexting. Snapchat is mostly for sharing goofy photos that months or years later might seem inane but at the time are hilarious. Using Poke for a few minutes I already get the feeling it can handle this silly and addicting use case well. I&#8217;ve already gotten a few laughs out of it.</p><p>Poke could successfully slow the growth of Snapchat and deter others from entering the space, which would keep more sharing in the Facebook ecosystem. Inevitably the question is how Facebook will make money on Poke. Right now there&#8217;s no ads. One day there might be, but its launch seems more focused on creating something fun for users while boxing out a potential disruptor. Mark Zuckerberg pulled the rug out from under Myspace, and he doesn&#8217;t want anyone doing the same to him.</p><p>Even if it doesn&#8217;t earn money directly, Poke is very important to Facebook. The people you send ephemeral messages to are often your closest friends. Facebook needs to know this intimate social graph to be able to tune its news feed and other parts of the service to show you the most relevant content. Because really, if you send someone a photo of you with a purple mustaches drawn on top, you probably want to see what they&#8217;re sharing with everyone else.</p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/#gallery-725205-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a><p><em>You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id588594730\">download Poke from the App Store here</a>. </em></p><p><em>And there&#8217;s a cute little Easter Egg in it. If you drag your messages list all the way up, you&#8217;ll see the text &#8220;I&#8217;ll find something to put here&#8221;. This is the same text Mark Zuckerberg left in the bottom of the Facebook.com footer in the early days of the site.</em></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725205/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ao20iia0sWE:1OQ-sY2RnOc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ao20iia0sWE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Let’s talk about drones.

Drones are to nation-states what assault rifles are to psychotic mass murderers. Worse yet, the way things are going, it’s only a matter of time until alpha insurgencies like Hezbollah and the Zetas have their own fleets of armed or kamikaze drones.</p><p>The sound-bite anti-gun-control argument is, of course, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” The counterargument is, “Yeah, but guns sure make it a whole lot easier.” The same applies to drone warfare. It’s suddenly so much easier to pull the trigger, and you’re not putting any of your own people at risk. And so more people die.</p><p><em>But surely sober, thoughtful, serious people make these decisions</em>, you may say, <em>aided by the fabled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix\">disposition matrix</a>.</em> If so, there are a few points you need to keep in mind:</p><ol><li>If you think drone warfare is going to stay limited to the relatively checked-and-balanced trigger fingers of the U.S. military, you are living in one of the more astoundingly deluded dreamlands of recent times. China has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/zhuhai/\">its own deadly military drones</a> already — oh, and it’s selling them to pretty much all comers.</li><li>If you think drone warfare of tomorrow will be as tame and limited as today’s, again, you’re dreaming. We’ve moved on from the Altair of military drone technology to maybe the Apple II. Imagine what the metaphorical ultrabooks will look like.</li><li>Most of all, <i>if something is easier, it will be done more often, with less consideration</i>. That’s basic, fundamental human nature. That’s why Amazon patented one-click shopping. Conversely, the more obstacles and inconveniences you put in the way, the less inclined people will be to go down that road — or at least, the bigger the reward at the end of it has to be. And that’s why military drones scare me even <i>before</i> they get into the hands of people who don’t much care about innocent lives.</li></ol><p>We’re already seeing evidence that drone warfare slowly leads to less consideration for civilian lives: the (apparently deliberate) use of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-drone-tweets-reveal-double-tap-plan-2012-12\">“double tap” strategy</a>, wherein a first missile is followed a few minutes later by another. From a strictly tactical point of view, this probably does kill more of the bad guys…but it also tends to kill rescuers and first responders.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-drone-tweets-reveal-double-tap-plan-2012-12\">only 2 percent</a> of the victims of the American drone war — a body count that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/09/03/august-2012-update-us-covert-actions-in-pakistan-yemen-and-somalia/\">now far exceeds</a> the number who died in the World Trade Center — were “high-level militants” and hundreds upon hundreds were civilians.</p><p>And again, this is only the beginning. That’s what scares me most. Drone wars may seem to those who wage them to be bloodless and clinical — but there’s every reason to believe that they’ll ultimately be far worse and far bloodier than even many of the horrors of the 20th century.</p><p><i>Image:</i> Hunter-killer, <i>The Terminator</i>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/724709/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_F-6f-G1RCI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/_F-6f-G1RCI/" (20693 48365) old 3 nil nil ((title nil "Single-Click Double-Tap Murder") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/_F-6f-G1RCI/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/single-click-double-tap-murder/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sat, 22 Dec 2012 14:00:13 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Jon Evans") (category nil "Opinion") (category nil "TC") (category nil "drones") (category nil "Murder") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Worse yet, the way things are going, it&#8217;s only a matter of time until alpha insurgencies like Hezbollah and the Zetas have their own fleets of armed or kamikaze drones.</p><p>The sound-bite anti-gun-control argument is, of course, &#8220;Guns don&#8217;t kill people, people kill people.&#8221; The counterargument is, &#8220;Yeah, but guns sure make it a whole lot easier.&#8221; The same applies to drone warfare. It&#8217;s suddenly so much easier to pull the trigger, and you&#8217;re not putting any of your own people at risk. And so more people die.</p><p><em>But surely sober, thoughtful, serious people make these decisions</em>, you may say, <em>aided by the fabled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix\">disposition matrix</a>.</em> If so, there are a few points you need to keep in mind:</p><ol><li>If you think drone warfare is going to stay limited to the relatively checked-and-balanced trigger fingers of the U.S. military, you are living in one of the more astoundingly deluded dreamlands of recent times. China has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/zhuhai/\">its own deadly military drones</a> already &#8212; oh, and it&#8217;s selling them to pretty much all comers.</li><li>If you think drone warfare of tomorrow will be as tame and limited as today&#8217;s, again, you&#8217;re dreaming. We&#8217;ve moved on from the Altair of military drone technology to maybe the Apple II. Imagine what the metaphorical ultrabooks will look like.</li><li>Most of all, <i>if something is easier, it will be done more often, with less consideration</i>. That&#8217;s basic, fundamental human nature. That&#8217;s why Amazon patented one-click shopping. Conversely, the more obstacles and inconveniences you put in the way, the less inclined people will be to go down that road &#8212; or at least, the bigger the reward at the end of it has to be. And that&#8217;s why military drones scare me even <i>before</i> they get into the hands of people who don&#8217;t much care about innocent lives.</li></ol><p>We&#8217;re already seeing evidence that drone warfare slowly leads to less consideration for civilian lives: the (apparently deliberate) use of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-drone-tweets-reveal-double-tap-plan-2012-12\">&#8220;double tap&#8221; strategy</a>, wherein a first missile is followed a few minutes later by another. From a strictly tactical point of view, this probably does kill more of the bad guys&#8230;but it also tends to kill rescuers and first responders.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-drone-tweets-reveal-double-tap-plan-2012-12\">only 2 percent</a> of the victims of the American drone war &#8212; a body count that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/09/03/august-2012-update-us-covert-actions-in-pakistan-yemen-and-somalia/\">now far exceeds</a> the number who died in the World Trade Center &#8212; were &#8220;high-level militants&#8221; and hundreds upon hundreds were civilians.</p><p>And again, this is only the beginning. That&#8217;s what scares me most. Drone wars may seem to those who wage them to be bloodless and clinical &#8212; but there&#8217;s every reason to believe that they&#8217;ll ultimately be far worse and far bloodier than even many of the horrors of the 20th century.</p><p><i>Image:</i> Hunter-killer, <i>The Terminator</i>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/724709/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_F-6f-G1RCI:QZClyHDxt-c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_F-6f-G1RCI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/single-click-double-tap-murder/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Facebook struck while the iron was hot and released a brand new <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/\">standalone iOS app called “Poke”</a>, leveraging a feature that has been around since the early days of the product, as well as a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-vs-snapchat-what-is-the-difference/\">shot across the bow of SnapChat</a>, who it reportedly attempted to acquire.</p><p>At first glance, it’s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/snapchat-co-founder-evan-spiegel-responds-to-poke-welcome-facebook-seriously/\">a competitive move</a>, and also a whimsical one. The idea of sending someone a message that self-destructs is kind of “cute”, in the way that passing notes in class was when you were younger. But make no mistake about it, Facebook’s Poke is meant as a means to strengthen its social graph, as well as to crib signals from your daily lives and activities to make itself a better company. I’m not saying that anything is wrong with that, but these are the obvious facts.</p><p>Let’s discuss the idea of a social signal first, though. When you tweet something, and someone responds, that’s a signal that the person is interested in what you have to say.

I would challenge that it’s not public data because it’s quite important. Whispering to someone is way more interesting than speaking to ten people in a crowd.</p><h3>Your closest friends</h3><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/facebook-poke-screenshot-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725590\"></a>When you’re at a bar and you look around at the people there, are you interested in what a group of fifteen people are talking about, or what the two folks in the corner are speaking about directly. You could infer that they’re having an intimate conversation, perhaps a closely connected moment. If it’s a guy and a girl, you might wonder if they’re dating, married or are about to “hook up”. The group of fifteen, however, are simply blowing off steam and having a good time. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for a company like Facebook, the connection in the corner is more valuable to them as a company, and you as a user.</p><p>Facebook has attempted to help you connect to the people who matter most by automatically and algorithmically creating a “Closest Friends” group on the service. This is probably based on a number of factors, although none of us who aren’t working at Facebook are sure. It’s probably a mix of how often you message them directly, how often you comment or like their status updates, how often you message them directly or even how often you visit their profile. All of the actions are “data points” and “social signals” to Facebook. All of this data then gets analyzed by people and algorithms to try and display the best experience possible for you on Facebook.</p><h3>The Best Experience Possible</h3><p>When I say that Facebook is trying to make it a better experience for you, I mean that it wants you to stay there and never leave. There’s nothing wrong with that, it should be the goal for every company with a social product. When you see content on your News Feed that is interesting, and you feel the need and want to engage, that’s a huge score for Facebook and eventually it’s advertisers.</p><p>Spending more time on Facebook, be it on the desktop or on mobile, is always the goal. You don’t go to a restaurant that you hate and spend a lot of money there, do you? Of course not. Great restaurants figure out a way to make you feel at home, more comfortable, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebooks-status-box-gets-more-personal-asks-you-whats-going-on-by-name/\">call you by your first name</a> all in the hopes that you’ll return and tell your friends to come too. It’s just good business.</p><p>Facebook is a business, don’t forget that. As is Twitter, Google, Microsoft, SnapChat, Instagram, Yahoo! and every other company that you use products from, for free. </p><h3>Business and Social</h3><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/10-facebook/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725591\"></a>People get up in arms when business and social interconnect. Why? Well, showing us ads on Facebook is like being a part of that fifteen person conversation in a bar, and then a Coca-Cola rep jumping in the middle and saying “Hey! Becky loves Coke, you should too! BYE!” Sounds obnoxious, doesn’t it? But that’s business, it happens every single day. There are Bud-Light signs in bars to attract you to the product, it’s just how it works.</p><p>What Facebook is doing with Poke is trying to figure out who you interact with privately the most. If they know that, then they know what ads will work better on you. If I Poke Josh Constine a lot, then they know that an ad with his face or content on it might just work on me. That’s pretty smart. It also creep some people out. Get used to it, though, it’s the present and the future.</p><p>Your whispers, while they aren’t technically being “read, watched or listened to” are being tracked as serious social signals. That’s why the app exists, it’s not because <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/mark-zuckerberg-voice-of-poke/\">Zuckerberg was bored and wanted to code</a>, don’t think that for a second.</p><h3>The value of a whisper</h3><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/2076184001_335e79ff9b_z/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725592\"></a>Google doesn’t “read” your email, just like Facebook won’t “look at” your Pokes. They don’t have time for that, they don’t care, and well, it’s illegal. But what these companies are doing is watching how you use their services so that they can tune them better to fit yours, and everyone else’s, needs.</p><p>This is how Facebook is going to attract the rest of the world’s population that aren’t using Facebook. It needs your data to survive. If you’re not OK with that, you have a choice to not use it. You can leave the Internet entirely. But what you can’t do is complain about it over and over. It’s life, it’s business and you are the product. Period.</p><p>While Facebook does feel like it has, and will continue to, change the world, it is a company with business models and now shareholders. The same goes for Google. Don’t be a cynic and think that Facebook or Google is evil. They’re not, they’re people just like you. But do go in with your eyes wide open.</p><p>Your whisper is more valuable than a public shout, say a comment on someone’s public status update about how cute their dog or child is. You could be commenting on the update to remind them that you’re there, or to show off in front of others. Facebook can’t know that. Nobody can.</p><p>But know this, Facebook is interested in your conversation, winks, hugs and kisses with that guy or girl in the bar, way back in the corner by the jukebox. Especially if you’re in a demographic that it doesn’t have a hold on. Like, younger crowds that SnapJoy has the attention of.</p><p>*Poke*</p><p>[Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shelbzyleigh/4852162426/\">Flickr</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschmid/2076184001/sizes/z/\">Flickr</a>]</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725581/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/gq65_PZmHXs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/gq65_PZmHXs/" (20693 56014) new 1 nil nil ((title nil "A Whisper Is A Stronger Social Signal Than A Public Shout") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/gq65_PZmHXs/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sat, 22 Dec 2012 16:07:42 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Drew Olanoff") (category nil "Opinion") (category nil "Social") (category nil "TC") (category nil "facebook") (category nil "whisper") (category nil "shout") (category nil "public") (category nil "social") (category nil "Poke") (category nil "signals") (category nil "social signals") (guid ((isPermaLink .

If they know that, then they know what ads will work better on you. If I Poke Josh Constine a lot, then they know that an ad with his face or content on it might just work on me. That&#8217;s pretty smart. It also creep some people out. Get used to it, though, it&#8217;s the present and the future.</p><p>Your whispers, while they aren&#8217;t technically being &#8220;read, watched or listened to&#8221; are being tracked as serious social signals. That&#8217;s why the app exists, it&#8217;s not because <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/mark-zuckerberg-voice-of-poke/\">Zuckerberg was bored and wanted to code</a>, don&#8217;t think that for a second.</p><h3>The value of a whisper</h3><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/2076184001_335e79ff9b_z/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-725592\"></a>Google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;read&#8221; your email, just like Facebook won&#8217;t &#8220;look at&#8221; your Pokes. They don&#8217;t have time for that, they don&#8217;t care, and well, it&#8217;s illegal. But what these companies are doing is watching how you use their services so that they can tune them better to fit yours, and everyone else&#8217;s, needs.</p><p>This is how Facebook is going to attract the rest of the world&#8217;s population that aren&#8217;t using Facebook. It needs your data to survive. If you&#8217;re not OK with that, you have a choice to not use it. You can leave the Internet entirely. But what you can&#8217;t do is complain about it over and over. It&#8217;s life, it&#8217;s business and you are the product. Period.</p><p>While Facebook does feel like it has, and will continue to, change the world, it is a company with business models and now shareholders. The same goes for Google. Don&#8217;t be a cynic and think that Facebook or Google is evil. They&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re people just like you. But do go in with your eyes wide open.</p><p>Your whisper is more valuable than a public shout, say a comment on someone&#8217;s public status update about how cute their dog or child is. You could be commenting on the update to remind them that you&#8217;re there, or to show off in front of others. Facebook can&#8217;t know that. Nobody can.</p><p>But know this, Facebook is interested in your conversation, winks, hugs and kisses with that guy or girl in the bar, way back in the corner by the jukebox. Especially if you&#8217;re in a demographic that it doesn&#8217;t have a hold on. Like, younger crowds that SnapJoy has the attention of.</p><p>*Poke*</p><p>[Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shelbzyleigh/4852162426/\">Flickr</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschmid/2076184001/sizes/z/\">Flickr</a>]</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/725581/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=gq65_PZmHXs:H9HSG371fhw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/gq65_PZmHXs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/a-whisper-is-a-stronger-social-signal-than-a-public-shout/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .
